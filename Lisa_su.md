## Early life and education

Lisa Tzwu-Fang Su was born in November[16][17] of 1969[18][19] in
[Tainan](Tainan "wikilink"), [Taiwan](Taiwan "wikilink"). She was born
in a [Taiwanese Hokkien](Taiwanese_Hokkien "wikilink") speaking
family.[20] She immigrated to the [United
States](United_States "wikilink")[21] at the age of 3 with her parents
Su Chun-hwai () and Sandy Lo ().[22][23] Both she and her brother were
encouraged to study math and science as children.[24] When she was
seven, her father – a retired [statistician](statistician "wikilink") –
began quizzing her on [multiplication
tables](multiplication_tables "wikilink"). Her mother, an
[accountant](accountant "wikilink") who later became an entrepreneur,
introduced her to business concepts.[25]

At a young age, Su aspired to be an engineer, explaining "I just had a
great curiosity about how things worked".[26] When she was 10, she began
taking apart and then fixing her brother's remote control cars,[27] and
she owned her first computer in junior high school, an [Apple
II](Apple_II "wikilink").[28] She attended the [Bronx High School of
Science](Bronx_High_School_of_Science "wikilink") in [New York
City](New_York_City "wikilink"), graduating in 1986.[29]

Su began attending the [Massachusetts Institute of
Technology](Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "wikilink") (MIT) in
the fall of 1986, intending to major in either [electrical
engineering](electrical_engineering "wikilink") or [computer
science](computer_science "wikilink"). She settled on electrical
engineering,[30] recollecting that it seemed like the most difficult
major.[31][32] During her freshman year she worked as an undergrad
[research assistant](research_assistant "wikilink") "manufacturing test
[silicon wafers](silicon_wafer "wikilink") for graduate students"[33]
through the [Undergraduate Research Opportunities
Program](Undergraduate_Research_Opportunities_Program "wikilink")
(UROP). The project, as well as her summer jobs at [Analog
Devices](Analog_Devices "wikilink"), fueled her interest in
[semiconductors](semiconductors "wikilink").[34] She remained focused on
the topic for the remainder of her education,[35] spending much of her
time in labs designing and adjusting products.[36]

After earning her [bachelor's degree](bachelor's_degree "wikilink") in
electrical engineering, Su obtained her [master's
degree](master's_degree "wikilink") from MIT in 1991. From 1990 to
1994[37] she studied for her [PhD](PhD "wikilink")[38] under MIT advisor
Dimitri Antoniadis.[39] *[MIT Technology
Review](MIT_Technology_Review "wikilink")* reports that as a doctoral
candidate, Su was "one of the first researchers to look into
[silicon-on-insulator](silicon-on-insulator "wikilink") (SOI)
technology, a then unproven technique for increasing
[transistors](transistor "wikilink")' efficiency by building them atop
layers of an insulating material".[40] She graduated with her PhD in
electrical engineering[41][42] from MIT in 1994.[43] Her PhD thesis was
titled *Extreme-submicrometer silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MOSFETs.*[44]

## Career

Su has been on the boards of [Analog
Devices](Analog_Devices "wikilink"),[45] [Cisco Systems,
Inc.](Cisco_Systems "wikilink"),[46] the Global Semiconductor Alliance,
and the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association.[47] As of 2016 she has
published over forty technical articles[48] and coauthored a book
chapter discussing next-generation consumer electronics.[49]

### 1994–1999: Texas Instruments and IBM R&D

In June 1994, Su became a member of the technical staff at [Texas
Instruments](Texas_Instruments "wikilink"),[50] working in the company's
Semiconductor Process and Device Center (SPDC)[51] until February
1995.[52] That month,[53] IBM hired Su as a research staff member
specializing in device physics,[54] and she was appointed [vice
president](vice_president "wikilink") of IBM's semiconductor research
and development center.[55]

During her time at IBM,[56] Su played a "critical role"[57] in
developing the "recipe"[58] to make copper connections work with
semiconductor chips instead of aluminum, "solving the problem of
preventing copper impurities from contaminating the devices during
production".[59] Working with various IBM design teams on the details of
the device, Su explained, "my specialty was not in copper, but I
migrated to where the problems were".[60] The copper technology was
launched in 1998,[61] resulting in new industry standards[62] and chips
that were up to 20% faster than the conventional versions.[63][64]

### 2000–2007: IBM Emerging Products division

In 2000, Su was given a year-long assignment as the technical assistant
for [Lou Gerstner](Lou_Gerstner "wikilink"), IBM's CEO. She subsequently
took on the role of director of emerging projects, stating that "I was
basically director of myself – there was no one else in the group".[65]
As head and founder of IBM's Emerging Products division, Su ran a
[startup company](startup_company "wikilink") and soon hired 10
employees to focus on [biochips](biochip "wikilink") and "low-power and
broadband semiconductors". Their first product was a microprocessor that
improved battery life in phones and other handheld devices.[66] *[MIT
Technology Review](MIT_Technology_Review "wikilink")* named her a "Top
Innovator Under 35" in 2001, in part due to her work with Emerging
Products.[67]

Through her division, Su represented IBM in a collaboration to create
next-generation chips with [Sony](Sony "wikilink") and
[Toshiba](Toshiba "wikilink"). [Ken Kutaragi](Ken_Kutaragi "wikilink")
charged the collaboration with "improving the performance of game
machine processors by a factor of 1,000", and Su's team eventually came
up with the idea for a nine-processor chip, which later became the [Cell
microprocessor](Cell_(microprocessor) "wikilink") used to power devices
such as the [Sony PlayStation 3](Sony_PlayStation_3 "wikilink"). She
continued as vice president of the semiconductor research and
development center at IBM,[68] holding the role until May 2007.[69]

### 2007–2011: Freescale Semiconductor

Su joined [Freescale Semiconductor](Freescale_Semiconductor "wikilink")
in June 2007[70][71] as [chief technology
officer](chief_technology_officer "wikilink") (CTO), heading the
company's research and development[72][73] until August 2009.[74] From
September 2008 until December 2011,[75] she was [senior vice
president](senior_vice_president "wikilink") and general manager of
Freescale's networking and multimedia group, and was responsible for
global strategy, marketing, and engineering for the company's embedded
communications and applications processor business.[76][77] As head of
the company's networking-chip business,[78] *[EE
Times](EE_Times "wikilink")* credited her with helping Freescale get
"its house in order", with the company filing for an
[IPO](IPO "wikilink") in 2011.[79]

### 2012–2014: AMD appointments

Su became [senior vice president](senior_vice_president "wikilink") and
general manager at [AMD](AMD "wikilink") in January 2012,[80] overseeing
the company's global business units[81][82] and the "end-to-end business
execution" of AMD's products.[83] Over the next two years she "played a
prominent role"[84] in pushing the company to diversify beyond the PC
market, including working with [Microsoft](Microsoft "wikilink") and
[Sony](Sony "wikilink") to place AMD chips in [Xbox
One](Xbox_One "wikilink") and [PS4](PS4 "wikilink") game consoles.[85]

On 8 October 2014, AMD announced Su's appointment to president and CEO,
replacing [Rory Read](Rory_Read "wikilink").[86][87] Su stated that her
plan for the company involved focusing on making the "right technology
investments", streamlining the product line, and continuing to
diversify, also asserting that she wanted to "simplify" the company and
accelerate the development of new technology.[88] A number of analysts
praised the appointment due to Su's credentials, noting AMD was seeking
growth in product areas where Su had "extensive experience".[89]

### 2015–2016: AMD diversification

When Su joined AMD in 2012, about 10 percent of sales came from non-PC
products.[90] By February 2015, roughly 40 percent of AMD's sales came
from non-PC markets, such as [video game
consoles](video_game_console "wikilink") and [embedded
devices](Embedded_system "wikilink"). In May 2015, Su and other AMD
executives presented a long-term strategy for the company to focus on
developing high-performance computing and graphics technologies for
three growth areas: gaming, datacenter, and "immersive platforms"
markets.[91]

In January 2016, Su announced that AMD was working on new
[FinFET](FinFET "wikilink")-based chips to create a new line of
microprocessors, products, accelerated processing units
([APUs](AMD_APU "wikilink")), graphics chips,[92] and semi-custom chip
designs for unreleased [video game
consoles](video_game_console "wikilink").[93][94] AMD's share value
spiked in July 2016, when AMD reported strong revenue growth.
*[Fortune](Fortune_(magazine) "wikilink")* attributed the "impressive"
statistic to Su, stating she "continues to execute on her comeback
plan ... key gains in graphics and video gaming console chips have
boosted results as well as a savvy deal to license server chip designs
in [China](China "wikilink")".[95]

### 2017–present: Ryzen

After the initial launch of [Zen](Zen_(microarchitecture) "wikilink")
chips in [quarter](Calendar_year "wikilink") two 2017,
[AMD](Advanced_Micro_Devices "wikilink")'s percentage of the
[CPU](Central_Processing_Unit "wikilink") [market
share](market_share "wikilink") surged to nearly 11%.[96] Ryzen CPUs
have received favorable reviews from a variety of news outlets,
specifically highlighting their high
[thread](Thread_(computing) "wikilink") counts at prices drastically
lower than those of Intel's, especially in the [high-performance
computing](High_Performance_Computing "wikilink") market with AMD's
[Ryzen Threadripper](Threadripper "wikilink") line of workstation
processors.[97][98][99][100][101] Su is the first woman ever to top The
Associated Press’ annual survey of CEO compensation: Her 2019 pay
package was valued at $58.5 million.[102]

In February 2022, Su became Chair of
[AMD](Advanced_Micro_Devices "wikilink") after completing a reported $49
billion acquisition of [FPGA](Field-programmable_gate_array "wikilink")
and programmable [systems on chip](System_on_a_chip "wikilink") maker
[Xilinx](Xilinx "wikilink").[103][104]
