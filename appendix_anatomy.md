# Appendix (anatomy)

The **appendix** (: **appendices** or **appendixes**; also **vermiform
appendix**; **cecal** (or **caecal**, **cæcal**) **appendix**;
**vermix**; or **vermiform process**) is a finger-like, blind-ended tube
connected to the [cecum](cecum "wikilink"), from which it [develops in
the embryo](prenatal_development "wikilink"). The cecum is a pouch-like
structure of the [large intestine](large_intestine "wikilink"), located
at the junction of the [small](small_intestine "wikilink") and the large
intestines. The term "[vermiform](vermiform "wikilink")" comes from
[Latin](Latin "wikilink") and means "worm-shaped". The appendix was once
considered a [vestigial organ](Human_vestigiality "wikilink"), but this
view has changed since the early 2000s.[1][2] Research suggests that the
appendix may serve an important purpose as a reservoir for beneficial
[gut bacteria](gut_bacteria "wikilink").

## Structure

The human appendix averages in length, ranging from . The diameter of
the appendix is , and more than is considered a thickened or inflamed
appendix. The longest appendix ever removed was long.[3] The appendix is
usually located in the lower right
[quadrant](quadrant_(anatomy) "wikilink") of the
[abdomen](abdomen "wikilink"), near the right [hip
bone](iliac_fossa "wikilink"). The base of the appendix is located
beneath the [ileocecal valve](ileocecal_valve "wikilink") that separates
the large intestine from the small intestine. Its position within the
abdomen corresponds to a point on the surface known as [McBurney's
point](McBurney's_point "wikilink").

The appendix is connected to the [mesentery](mesentery "wikilink") in
the lower region of the [ileum](ileum "wikilink"), by a short region of
the [mesocolon](mesentery "wikilink") known as the
[mesoappendix](mesentery#Segments "wikilink").[4]

### Variation

Some identical twins—known as [mirror image
twins](Twin#Mirror_image_twins "wikilink")—can have a [mirror-imaged
anatomy](situs_inversus "wikilink"), a [congenital
condition](congenital_disorder "wikilink") with the appendix located in
the lower left quadrant of the abdomen instead of the lower right.[5][6]
[Intestinal malrotation](Intestinal_malrotation "wikilink") may also
cause displacement of the appendix to the left side.

While the base of the appendix is typically located below the [ileocecal
valve](ileocecal_valve "wikilink"), the tip of the appendix can be
variably located—in the [pelvis](pelvis "wikilink"), outside the
[peritoneum](peritoneum "wikilink") or behind the cecum.[7] The
prevalence of the different positions varies amongst populations with
the retrocecal position being most common in [Ghana](Ghana "wikilink")
and [Sudan](Sudan "wikilink"), with 67.3% and 58.3% occurrence
respectively, in comparison to [Iran](Iran "wikilink") and
[Bosnia](Bosnia "wikilink") where the pelvic position is most common,
with 55.8% and 57.7% occurrence respectively.[8][9][10][11]

In very rare cases, the appendix may not be present at all
([laparotomies](laparotomy "wikilink") for suspected appendicitis have
given a frequency of 1 in 100,000).[12]

Sometimes there is a semi-circular fold of [mucous
membrane](mucous_membrane "wikilink") at the opening of the appendix.
This *valve of the vermiform appendix* is also called
[Gerlach's](Joseph_von_Gerlach "wikilink") valve.[13]

## Functions

### Maintaining gut flora

Although it has been long accepted that the immune tissue surrounding
the appendix and elsewhere in the gut—called [gut-associated lymphoid
tissue](gut-associated_lymphoid_tissue "wikilink")—carries out a number
of important functions, explanations were lacking for the distinctive
shape of the appendix and its apparent lack of specific importance and
function as judged by an absence of side effects following [its
removal](appendectomy "wikilink").[14] Therefore, the notion that the
appendix is only [vestigial](vestigiality "wikilink") became widely
held.

William Parker, Randy Bollinger, and colleagues at [Duke
University](Duke_University "wikilink") proposed in 2007 that the
appendix serves as a haven for useful [bacteria](bacteria "wikilink")
when illness flushes the bacteria from the rest of the
intestines.[15][16] This proposition is based on an understanding that
emerged by the early 2000s of how the immune system supports the growth
of beneficial [intestinal bacteria](gut_flora "wikilink"),[17][18] in
combination with many well-known features of the appendix, including its
architecture, its location just below the normal one-way flow of food
and germs in the large intestine, and its association with copious
amounts of immune tissue. Research performed at [Winthrop–University
Hospital](Winthrop–University_Hospital "wikilink") showed that
individuals without an appendix were four times as likely to have a
recurrence of [*Clostridium difficile*
colitis](Clostridium_difficile_colitis "wikilink").[19] The appendix,
therefore, may act as a "safe house" for beneficial bacteria.[20] This
reservoir of bacteria could then serve to repopulate the [gut
flora](gut_flora "wikilink") in the [digestive
system](human_digestive_system "wikilink") following a bout of
[dysentery](dysentery "wikilink") or [cholera](cholera "wikilink") or to
boost it following a milder gastrointestinal illness.[21]

### Immune and lymphatic systems

The appendix has been identified as an important component of mammalian
[mucosal immune function](mucosal_immunology "wikilink"), particularly
[B cell](B_cell "wikilink")-mediated immune responses and
[extrathymically](thymus "wikilink") derived [T
cells](T_cell "wikilink"). This structure helps in the proper movement
and removal of waste matter in the digestive system, contains lymphatic
vessels that regulate pathogens, and lastly, might even produce early
defences that prevent deadly diseases. Additionally, it is thought that
this may provide more immune defences from invading pathogens and
getting the lymphatic system's B and T cells to fight the viruses and
bacteria that infect that portion of the bowel and training them so that
immune responses are targeted and more able to reliably and less
dangerously fight off pathogens.[22] In addition, there are different
immune cells called [innate lymphoid
cells](innate_lymphoid_cell "wikilink") that function in the gut in
order to help the appendix maintain digestive health.[23] Research also
shows a positive correlation between the existence of the appendix and
the concentration of cecal lymphoid tissue, which supports the
suggestion that not only does the appendix evolve as a complex with the
cecum but also has major immune benefits.[24]

## Clinical significance

Common [diseases](disease "wikilink") of the appendix (in humans) are
[appendicitis](appendicitis "wikilink") and
[carcinoid](carcinoid "wikilink") tumors (appendiceal carcinoid).[25]
[Appendix cancer](Appendix_cancer "wikilink") accounts for about 1 in
200 of all gastrointestinal malignancies. In rare cases,
[adenomas](adenomas "wikilink") are also present.[26]

### Appendicitis

[Appendicitis](Appendicitis "wikilink") is a condition characterized by
[inflammation](inflammation "wikilink") of the appendix. Pain often
begins in the center of the abdomen, corresponding to the appendix's
development as part of the embryonic [midgut](midgut "wikilink"). This
pain is typically a dull, poorly localized,
[visceral](viscus "wikilink") pain.[27]

As the inflammation progresses, the pain begins to localize more clearly
to the right lower quadrant, as the [peritoneum](peritoneum "wikilink")
becomes inflamed. This peritoneal inflammation, or
[peritonitis](peritonitis "wikilink"), results in [rebound
tenderness](rebound_tenderness "wikilink") (pain upon removal of
pressure rather than application of pressure). In particular, it
presents at [McBurney's point](McBurney's_point "wikilink"), 1/3 of the
way along a line drawn from the [anterior superior iliac
spine](anterior_superior_iliac_spine "wikilink") to the
[umbilicus](navel "wikilink"). Typically, point (skin) pain is not
present until the [parietal peritoneum](parietal_peritoneum "wikilink")
is inflamed, as well. Fever and an immune system response are also
characteristic of appendicitis.[28] Other signs and symptoms may include
[nausea](nausea "wikilink") and vomiting, low-grade fever that may get
worse, [constipation](constipation "wikilink") or
[diarrhea](diarrhea "wikilink"), abdominal bloating, or
[flatulence](flatulence "wikilink").[29]

Appendicitis usually requires the removal of the inflamed appendix, in
an [appendectomy](appendectomy "wikilink") either by
[laparotomy](laparotomy "wikilink") or
[laparoscopy](laparoscopy "wikilink"). Untreated, the appendix may
rupture, leading to [peritonitis](peritonitis "wikilink"), followed by
[shock](septic_shock "wikilink"), and, if still untreated, death.[30]

### Surgery

The surgical removal of the appendix is called an
[appendectomy](appendectomy "wikilink"). This removal is normally
performed as an emergency procedure when the patient is suffering from
[acute](acute_(medical) "wikilink") appendicitis. In the absence of
surgical facilities, [intravenous](intravenous "wikilink")
[antibiotics](antibiotics "wikilink") are used to delay or avoid the
onset of [sepsis](sepsis "wikilink"). In some cases, the appendicitis
resolves completely; more often, an inflammatory mass forms around the
appendix. This is a relative
[contraindication](contraindication "wikilink") to surgery.

The appendix is also used for the construction of an efferent urinary
conduit, in an operation known as the [Mitrofanoff
procedure](Mitrofanoff_procedure "wikilink"),[31] in people with a
[neurogenic bladder](neurogenic_bladder "wikilink").

The appendix is also used as a means to access the colon in children
with paralysed bowels or major rectal sphincter problems. The appendix
is brought out to the skin surface and the child/parent can then attach
a catheter and easily wash out the colon (via normal defaecation) using
an appropriate solution.[32]

## History

[Charles Darwin](Charles_Darwin "wikilink") suggested that the appendix
was mainly used by earlier hominids for digesting fibrous vegetation,
then evolved to take on a new purpose over time. The very long cecum of
some herbivorous animals, such as in the [horse](horse "wikilink") or
the [koala](koala "wikilink"), appears to support this hypothesis. The
koala's cecum enables it to host bacteria that specifically help to
break down cellulose. Human ancestors may have also relied upon this
system when they lived on a diet rich in foliage. As people began to eat
more easily digested foods, they may have become less reliant on
cellulose-rich plants for energy. As the cecum became less necessary for
digestion, mutations that were previously deleterious (and would have
hindered evolutionary progress) were no longer important, so the
mutations survived. It is suggested that these
[alleles](allele "wikilink") became more frequent and the cecum
continued to shrink. After millions of years, the once-necessary cecum
degraded to be the appendix of modern humans.[33]

Dr. Heather F. Smith of [Midwestern
University](Midwestern_University "wikilink") and colleagues explained:

In a 2013 paper, the appendix was found to have independently evolved in
different animals at least 32 times (and perhaps as many as 38 times)
and to have been lost no more than six times over the course of history.
[35] A more recent study using similar methods on an updated database
yielded similar, though less spectacular results, with at least 29 gains
and at the most 12 losses (all of which were ambiguous), and this is
still significantly asymmetrical.[36] This suggests that the cecal
appendix has a selective advantage in many situations and argues
strongly against its vestigial nature. Given that this organ may have a
selective advantage in numerous situations, it appears to have effects
that are unique to certain species. For example, in a 2023 study, the
protective functions conferred against diarrhea were only observed in
humans.[37] This complex evolutionary history of the appendix, along
with a great heterogeneity in its evolutionary rate in various taxa,
suggests that it is a recurrent trait.[38]

Such a function may be useful in a culture lacking modern sanitation and
healthcare practice, where [diarrhea](diarrhea "wikilink") may be
prevalent. Current [epidemiological](epidemiology "wikilink") data on
the cause of death in developing countries collected by the [World
Health Organization](World_Health_Organization "wikilink") in 2001 show
that acute diarrhea is now the fourth leading cause of disease-related
death in developing countries (data summarized by the [Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation](Bill_and_Melinda_Gates_Foundation "wikilink")). Two of
the other leading causes of death are expected to have exerted limited
or no selection pressure.[39]
