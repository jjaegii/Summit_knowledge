# Indian elephant

The **Indian elephant** (***Elephas maximus indicus***) is one of three
extant recognized [subspecies](subspecies "wikilink") of the [Asian
elephant](Asian_elephant "wikilink"), native to mainland
[Asia](Asia "wikilink"). The species is smaller than the
[African](African_elephant "wikilink") elephant species with a convex
back and the highest body point on its head. The species exhibits
significant [sexual dimorphism](sexual_dimorphism "wikilink") with a
male reaching an average shoulder height of about and weighing up to
whereas a female reaches an average shoulder height of about and weighs
up to . It has a broader [skull](skull "wikilink") with a concave
forehead, two large laterally folded ears and a large trunk. It has grey
colored smooth skin with four large legs and a long tail.

The Indian elephant is native to mainland Asia with nearly three-fourth
of the population found in [India](India "wikilink"). The species is
also found in other countries of the [Indian
subcontinent](Indian_subcontinent "wikilink") including
[Nepal](Nepal "wikilink"), [Bangladesh](Bangladesh "wikilink"),
[Bhutan](Bhutan "wikilink"), [Myanmar](Myanmar "wikilink") and [South
East Asian](South_East_Asia "wikilink") countries inlcuding
[Thailand](Thailand "wikilink"), [Malaysia](Malaysia "wikilink"),
[Laos](Laos "wikilink"), [Cambodia](Cambodia "wikilink"), and
[Vietnam](Vietnam "wikilink") with small populations in
[China](China "wikilink"). It inhabits grasslands, dry
[deciduous](Deciduous_forests "wikilink"), moist deciduous,
[evergreen](evergreen_forest "wikilink") and semi-evergreen forests
across the range. The species is classified as a
[megaherbivore](megaherbivore "wikilink") and consume up to of plant
matter per day. They consume a variety of diet depending on the habitat
and seasons and might include leaves and twigs of fresh foliage, thorn
bearing shoots, flowering plants, fruits and grass.

Since 1986, the Asian elephant has been listed as
[Endangered](endangered_species "wikilink") on the [IUCN Red
List](IUCN_Red_List "wikilink") as the wild population has declined by
at least 50% over the last three elephant generations. The species is
threatened by [environmental
degradation](Environmental_degradation "wikilink"), [habitat
loss](habitat_loss "wikilink") and
[fragmentation](habitat_fragmentation "wikilink").
[Poaching](Poaching "wikilink") of elephants for
[ivory](ivory "wikilink") is a serious threat in some parts of Asia.
[Project Elephant](Project_Elephant "wikilink") was launched in 1992 by
the [Government of India](Government_of_India "wikilink") to protect
elephant habitats and population.

The Indian elephant is a cultural symbol throughout its range and
appears in various religious traditions and mythologies. The elephants
are treated positively and is revered as a form of Lord
[Ganesha](Ganesha "wikilink") in [Hinduism](Hinduism "wikilink"). It has
been designated the national heritage animal in India and is the
national animal of Thailand and Laos.

## Taxonomy

The Indian elephant (*Elephas maximus indicus*) is one of three extant
recognized [subspecies](subspecies "wikilink") of the [Asian
elephant](Asian_elephant "wikilink"). [Carl
Linnaeus](Carl_Linnaeus "wikilink") proposed the [scientific
name](scientific_name "wikilink") *Elephas maximus* in 1758 for an
elephant from [Ceylon](Ceylon "wikilink"). *Elephas indicus* was
proposed by [Georges Cuvier](Georges_Cuvier "wikilink") in 1798, who
described an elephant from India. [Frederick Nutter
Chasen](Frederick_Nutter_Chasen "wikilink") classified all three as
[subspecies](subspecies "wikilink") of the Asian elephant in 1940.

## Description

In general, Asian elephant is smaller than [African
elephant](African_elephant "wikilink"). Its back is convex or level with
the highest body point on its head. The species exhibits significant
[sexual dimorphism](sexual_dimorphism "wikilink") with a male reaching
an average shoulder height of about and weighing upto whereas a female
reaches an average shoulder height of about and weighs upto . The
largest Indian elephant was high at the shoulder. On average, it
measures in length including the trunk.

It has a broader [skull](skull "wikilink") with a concave forehead and
two dorsal bulges on the top. Two large laterally folded ears and a
large trunk with one finger-like process are attached to the head. It
has 20 pairs of [ribs](ribs "wikilink") and 34
[vertebrae](vertebrae "wikilink"). There are four large legs which are
almost straight with broader toes and with five nail like structures on
each foreleg and four on each of the hind-legs. The large legs help
support the larger weight for longer periods without spending much
energy with the broad feet helping to cushion against hard surfaces.
It has a long tail measuring on average in length. The skin color is
generally grey and lighter than that of *[E. m.
maximus](Elephas_maximus_maximus "wikilink")* but darker than that of
*[E. m. sumatranus](Elephas_maximus_sumatranus "wikilink")*. The skin is
generally smoother than that of the African species and might consist of
smaller patches of white [depigmentation](depigmentation "wikilink") or
grey spots. The body is covered by brownish to reddish hairs which
reduce and darken with age. The female is usually smaller than the
male with short or no [tusks](tusks "wikilink"). There are about 29
narrow cheek teeth.

## Distribution and habitat

The Indian elephant is native to mainland Asia with nearly three-fourth
of the population found in [India](India "wikilink"). The species is
also found in other countries of the [Indian
subcontinent](Indian_subcontinent "wikilink") including
[Nepal](Nepal "wikilink"), [Bangladesh](Bangladesh "wikilink"),
[Bhutan](Bhutan "wikilink"), [Myanmar](Myanmar "wikilink") and [South
East Asian](South_East_Asia "wikilink") countries inlcuding
[Thailand](Thailand "wikilink"), [Malaysia](Malaysia "wikilink"),
[Laos](Laos "wikilink"), [Cambodia](Cambodia "wikilink"), and
[Vietnam](Vietnam "wikilink") with small populations in
[China](China "wikilink"). It is regionally extinct in
[Pakistan](Pakistan "wikilink"). It inhabits grasslands, dry
[deciduous](Deciduous_forests "wikilink"), moist deciduous,
[evergreen](evergreen_forest "wikilink") and semi-evergreen forests. The
total estimated wild population ranges from 23,000 to 41,000 individuals
across the range. As per the 2017 census, the estimated wild
population in India was 27,312 individuals which account for nearly
three-fourths of the extant population.

The movement and habitat utilization patterns of an elephant population
were studied in southern India during 1981–83 within a study area. The
vegetation types of this area encompasses dry [thorn
forest](thorn_forest "wikilink") at , [deciduous
forest](deciduous_forest "wikilink") at , stunted [evergreen
forest](evergreen_forest "wikilink") and grassland at . Five different
elephant clans, each consisting of between 50 and 200 individuals had
home ranges of between and , which overlapped. They preferred habitat
where water was available and food plants were palatable. During the dry
months of January to April, they congregated at high densities of up to
five individuals per km<sup>2</sup> in river valleys where they
[browsed](Browsing_(herbivory) "wikilink") plants that had a much higher
[protein](protein "wikilink") content than the coarse tall grasses on
hill slopes. With the onset of rains in May, they dispersed over a wider
area at lower densities, largely into the tall grass forests, to feed on
the fresh grasses, which then had a high protein value. During the
second wet season from September to December, when the tall grasses
became fibrous, they moved into lower elevation short grass open
forests. The normal movement pattern could be upset during years of
adverse environmental conditions. However, the movement pattern of
elephants in this region has not basically changed for over a century,
as inferred from descriptions recorded during the 19th century. In
the [Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve](Nilgiri_Biosphere_Reserve "wikilink"),
three elephant clans had overall home ranges of , and in the beginning
of the 1990s. During three years of survey, their annual home ranges
overlapped to a large extent with only minor shifts in the home ranges
between years.

There are about 138 identified elephant corridors in India with the
majority of the elephant population in India is restricted to four
general areas.

### Elephant corridors in India
In the North-East region of India, from the eastern border of Nepal in northern West Bengal through western Assam along the Himalaya foothills as far as the Mishmi Hills, extending into eastern Arunachal Pradesh, the plains of upper Assam, and the foothills of Nagaland, to the Garo Hills of Meghalaya through the Khasi Hills, to parts of the lower Brahmaputra plains and Karbi Plateau; isolated herds occur in Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur, and in the Barak Valley districts of Assam there are 58 elephant corridors. In 2017, the elephant population in the North-East region of India was 10,139 elephants which was 33.8% of the elephant population.

In the East region of India, in Odisha, Jharkhand, and in the southern part of West Bengal, with some animals wandering into Chhattisgarh, there are 54 elephant corridors. In 2017, the elephant population in the East region of India was 3,128 elephants which was 10.4% of the elephant population.

In the North region of India, at the foot of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, ranging from Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary to the Yamuna River, there are 8 elephant corridors. In 2017, the elephant population in the North region of India was 2,085 which was 7% of the elephant population. 

In the South region of India, Eight populations are fragmented from each other in northern Karnataka, in the crestline of Karnataka–Western Ghats, in Bhadra–Malnad, in Brahmagiri–Nilgiris–Eastern Ghats, in Nilambur–Silent Valley–Coimbatore, in Anamalai–Parambikulam, in Periyar–Srivilliputhur, and one in Agasthyamalai, there are 46 elephant corridors. In 2017, the elephant population in the South region of India was 14,612 which was 48.8% of the population. 

Apart from India, following is the distribution and estimated population
of Indian elephants across Asia.

    in the south along the border with India
-   4,000–5,000 in Myanmar, where populations are highly fragmented, and
    occur in the northern ranges and [Arakan
    Yoma](Arakan_Yoma "wikilink") in the west, [Pegu
    Yoma](Pegu_Yoma "wikilink") of central Myanmar,
    [Tenasserim](Tanintharyi_Region "wikilink") and [Shan
    State](Shan_State "wikilink")

    with Myanmar, with smaller fragmented populations occurring in the
    peninsula in the south
-   2,100–3,100 in Malaysia
-   500–1,000 Laos, where they remain widely but patchily distributed in
    forested areas, both in the highlands and lowlands
-   200–250 in China, where they survive only in the prefectures of
    [Xishuangbanna](Xishuangbanna "wikilink"),
    [Simao](Simao_District "wikilink"), and
    [Lincang](Lincang "wikilink") of southern
    [Yunnan](Yunnan "wikilink")
-   250–600 in Cambodia, where they primarily inhabit the mountains of
    the south-west and in [Mondulkiri](Mondulkiri_Province "wikilink")
    and [Ratanakiri Provinces](Ratanakiri_Province "wikilink")
-   70–150 in the southern parts of Vietnam

## Behavior and ecology

### Diet and feeding

Elephant is classified as a [megaherbivore](megaherbivore "wikilink")
and can consume up to of plant matter per day. It can spend upto 19
hours a day foraging for food and can produce up to 220 pounds of
[dung](Manure "wikilink") per day. It is a generalist feeder and
both a [grazer](Grazing "wikilink") and a
[browser](Browsing_(predation) "wikilink"). In a study area of in
southern India, elephants were recorded to feed on 112 different plant
species, most commonly of the order [Malvales](Malvales "wikilink"), and
the [legume](Leguminosae "wikilink"), [palm](Palmae "wikilink"),
[sedge](Cyperaceae "wikilink") and [true grass](Graminae "wikilink")
families. They graze on the [tall grasses](Themeda "wikilink"), but the
portion consumed varies with season. When the new flush appears in
April, they remove the tender blades in small clumps. Later, when
grasses are higher than , they uproot entire clumps, dust them and
consume the fresh leave tops, but discard the roots. When grasses are
mature in autumn, they clean and consume the succulent basal portions
with the roots, and discard the fibrous blades. From the
[bamboos](bamboo "wikilink"), they eat seedlings, culms and lateral
shoots. During the dry season from January to April, they mainly browse
on both leaves and twigs preferring the fresh foliage, and consume thorn
bearing shoots of [acacia](acacia "wikilink") species without any
obvious discomfort. They feed on the bark of [white
thorn](Acacia_suma "wikilink") and other flowering plants, and consume
the fruits of [wood apple](Limonia_(plant) "wikilink"),
[tamarind](tamarind "wikilink"), [kumbhi](Careya_arborea "wikilink") and
[date palm](Phoenix_(plant) "wikilink").

During a study in a tropical moist mixed deciduous forested area of in
Assam, elephants were observed to feed on about 20 species of grasses,
plants and trees. Grasses such as *[Imperata
cylindrica](Imperata_cylindrica "wikilink")* and *[Leersia
hexandra](Leersia_hexandra "wikilink")* constituted the most predominant
component of their diet. In Nepal's [Bardia National
Park](Bardia_National_Park "wikilink"), elephants consume large amounts
of the [floodplain grass](Saccharum_spontaneum "wikilink"), particularly
during the [monsoon](monsoon "wikilink") season. They browse more in the
dry season with bark constituting a major part of their diet.

### Social structure

Indian elephants typically live in small herds consisting of related
females, their female offspring and young immature males. The elephants
are extremely social animals and form complex social relationships. They
often work together as a group to raise their young and to protect the
herd. While individual herds might not have a designated matriarch,
older females will take on a more dominant role within the herd. A
male elephant is typically encouraged to leave the herd once it reaches
puberty which often happens between the ages of 8 and 13. This is a
gradual process most of the times and is determined by the male's
competitive and independent nature and the tolerance of the herd.
Juvenile males tend to form loose herds while they typically become
independent on ageing.

### Communication and intelligence

An elephant communicates using low-pitched sounds and
[infrasonic](infrasonic "wikilink") grunts or rumbles. Various sounds
are produced that can communicate specific information to other
elephants over long distances. A female make different calls and
low-frequency vocalizations to warn of predators. An elephant has a
developed [olfactory](olfactory "wikilink") system and is able to
discern various scents. Wind-born scents can be sensed and used to
communicate clues regarding the presence of other elephants or potential
dangers. The trunk is also used for greeting other elephants and
communication of emotions such as excitement, competition, dominance,
discipline, reassurance etc. An elephant has a large brain which
weighs between . It is a highly intelligent animal with a great capacity
to learn new things. Much of elephant behavior is learned from the
elders over the years rather than being instinctive.

### Lifespan and mortality

Indian elephant has a lifespan between 40 and 65 years with some animals
reported to have lived for more than 75 years. As per available
evidence, an Indian elephant may typically live into their mid-50s, but
there is no consistent data available to accurately estimate the
lifespan of wild elephants. The median life expectancy for female
elephants was estimated to be 47 years old. An adult elephant has no
enemies in the wild except for humans but young elephants are often
susceptible to attacks by [carnivorous](carnivorous "wikilink")
predators such as [tigers](Bengal_tiger "wikilink") in the areas where
their ranges overlap. When a predator is visible, elder members of the
herd may emit warning calls that prompt the rest of the herd to group
together for protection.

### Reproduction

A female produces various noises to indicate her presence and readiness
to male bulls. An elephant can determine the identity, sex and
reproductive status of another elephant using its trunks to smell the
elephant's mouth, temporal gland, genitals, urine or dung. An Indian
elephant reaches sexual maturity between 8 and 13 years of age but might
not mate until later. While a female might bear calves starting a few
years later, a male is unlikely to become a father until the 30s due to
competition with older, larger males. An older male experiences a period
of heightened sexual and aggressive activity called *musth*, which is
caused by the production of large quantities of
[testosterone](testosterone "wikilink"). During the period, a green
fluid secreted from the elephant's temporal glands drips from the penis.
A female [ovulates](ovulation "wikilink") once about every 115 days and
if fertilized, the [gestation](gestation "wikilink") period is about 22
months, the longest gestation period of any animal.

Most often, a female gives birth to a single calf (occasionally two
might be born), which may weigh between . A calf is able to stand
and nurse soon after birth and start to feed on solid food by six
months. A calf will also eat its mother's dung for several years, which
contain nutrients and symbiotic bacteria that aid in the digestion of
plant food. A female might not give birth to another calf for an
interval of three to eight years, depending on environmental conditions.
A calf is [weaned](weaning "wikilink") slowly and might often continue
to be nursed by the mother until she delivers another calf or if it
reaches puberty. While a males leaves its natal herd at sexual maturity,
a female remain within the herd throughout its life.

## Status and conservation

Since 1986, the Asian elephant has been listed as
[Endangered](endangered_species "wikilink") on the [IUCN Red
List](IUCN_Red_List "wikilink") as the wild population has declined by
at least 50% over the last three elephant generations. The species
is threatened by [environmental
degradation](Environmental_degradation "wikilink"), [habitat
loss](habitat_loss "wikilink") and
[fragmentation](habitat_fragmentation "wikilink"), which are driven by
an [expanding human population](Population_growth "wikilink") and in
turn lead to increasing conflicts between humans and elephants when
elephants eat or trample crops. Significant extents of elephant
range and suitable habitat has been lost with their free movement
impeded by reservoirs and dams,
[hydroelectric](hydroelectricity "wikilink") projects and associated
canals, numerous pockets of cultivation and plantations, highways,
railway lines, mining and other [industrial
development](industrial_development "wikilink").
[Poaching](Poaching "wikilink") of elephants for
[ivory](ivory "wikilink") is a serious threat in some parts of Asia.
Poaching of tuskers impact the sex ratios that become highly female
biased and the [genetic variation](genetic_variation "wikilink") is
reduced with a decline in [fecundity](fecundity "wikilink") and
recruitment. In a study conducted at the [Periyar Tiger
Reserve](Periyar_Tiger_Reserve "wikilink"), Poaching has dramatically
skewed adult sex ratios between 1969 and 1989 with the adult male:female
sex ratio changing from 1:6 to 1:122. In India, elephant mortality
also occurs due to railway accidents with railway track running across
elephant corridors. Elephants that pass through from one forest patch to
another dash against the trains and die. In East India, a total of 39
dead elephants were reported during the period of 1958 to 2008, of which
ten were reportedly killed between 2004 and 2008. Electrocution due
to contact with electric poles and transformers has been reported as
another major threat to elephants in India, with an estimated 461
elephants having been electrocuted between 2009 and 2017.
[thumb|left|upright=0.8|Indian elephants are often held captive for
various purposes. Pictured is a captive elephant in
Thailand](File:Elephant,_Kok_River,_Chiang_Rai,_Thailand.jpg "wikilink")
In Bangladesh, forested areas that served as prime elephant habitat have
undergone drastic reduction, which had a severe impact on the wild
elephant population. Habitat loss and fragmentation is attributed to the
increasing human population and its need for fuel wood and timber which
results in [illegal logging](Illegal_logging "wikilink") resulting in
deforestation and habitat degradation. As a result of the shrinking
habitat, elephants have become prone to coming into direct conflict with
humans. In Myanmar, demand for elephant ivory has led to poaching
with [ivory trade](ivory_trade "wikilink") providing significant income.
In the clandestine market, prices of raw ivory increased from $76 per
kilogram in 1989-90 to over $200 per kilogram by the mid-1990s with
foreign tourists often responsible for the demand which fuels the
illegal killing of elephants. There is also a sizeable trade in ivory
[chopsticks](chopsticks "wikilink") and carvings,
[smuggled](Wildlife_trade#Illegal_wildlife_trade "wikilink") by traders
from Myanmar into China. Many elephants are also captured, raised in
captivity and used for various purposes such as logging, tourism,
religious festivals and show events. Young wild-born elephant calves
are separated from their mothers in Myanmar for use in Thailand's
tourism industry. The mothers are often killed in the process of
capturing and the calves are placed alongside already captive unrelated
cows. Then the calves are often subjected to a 'breaking in' process,
which may involve being tied up, confined, starved, beaten and tortured,
as a result of which two-thirds may perish.

### Conservation

Indian elephant is a protected species under Schedule I of the Indian
Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. [Project
Elephant](Project_Elephant "wikilink") was launched in 1992 by the
[Ministry of Environment and
Forests](Ministry_of_Environment_and_Forests "wikilink") of [Government
of India](Government_of_India "wikilink") to provide financial and
technical support of [wildlife
management](wildlife_management "wikilink") efforts by the states. The
project aims to ensure long-term survival of viable [conservation
reliant](Conservation_reliant_species "wikilink") populations of
elephants in their natural habitats by protecting the elephants, their
habitats and [migration corridors](Wildlife_corridor "wikilink"). It
also sought to enable various activities to address the issue of
human-animal conflict, promote the welfare of elephants in captivity,
support research of the ecology and management of elephants, creating
[conservation awareness](Conservation_movement "wikilink") among local
people and providing improved veterinary care for captive elephants.
As of December 2023, there are 33 notified elephant reserves in India,
covering .

## Culture

The Indian elephant is a cultural symbol throughout its range in Asia
and appears in various [religious
traditions](Asian_religions "wikilink") and mythologies. The elephants
are treated positively and are sometimes revered as deities, often
symbolizing strength, wisdom and good fortune. It is revered as a
form of Lord [Ganesha](Ganesha "wikilink") in
[Hinduism](Hinduism "wikilink"). Although Ganesha has many attributes,
he is readily identified by his elephant head. It is also revered as
a [part](Ganesha_in_Buddhism "wikilink") of
[Buddhist](Buddhism "wikilink") pantheon of Gods. Elephants are
often used as part of [temples](Hindu_temple "wikilink") and elaborate
rituals. They form an important part of Hindu festivals like
[Dussehra](Dussehra "wikilink") and [Pooram](Pooram "wikilink").

In India, it has been designated the national heritage animal. It is
the national animal of Thailand and Laos. The Indian elephant is
also the [state animal](List_of_Indian_state_symbols "wikilink") of the
Indian states of [Jharkhand](Jharkhand "wikilink"),
[Karnataka](Karnataka "wikilink"), [Kerala](Kerala "wikilink") and
[Odisha](Odisha "wikilink").
