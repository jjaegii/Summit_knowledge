# Hungry Jack's
**Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd.** is an Australian fast food franchise of the
[Burger King](Burger_King "wikilink") Corporation. It is a wholly owned
subsidiary of [Competitive Foods
Australia](Competitive_Foods_Australia "wikilink") (with licensing from
[Restaurant Brands
International](Restaurant_Brands_International "wikilink")), a privately
held company owned by [Jack Cowin](Jack_Cowin "wikilink"). Hungry Jack's
owns and operates or sub-licenses all of the Burger King/Hungry Jack's
restaurants in Australia.

As the master franchise for Australia, the company is responsible for
licensing new operators, opening its own stores and performing standards
oversight of franchised locations in Australia. With over 400 locations
across Australia, Hungry Jack's is the second-largest
[franchise](Franchising "wikilink") of Burger King in the world (second
to [Carrols Corporation](Carrols_Corporation "wikilink")).

## Corporate profile

### Early history

When Burger King moved to expand its operations into Australia, it found
that its business name was already trademarked by a takeaway food shop
in [Adelaide](Adelaide "wikilink"), South Australia. As a result,
Burger King provided the Australian franchisee, [Jack
Cowin](Jack_Cowin "wikilink"), with a list of possible alternative names
derived from pre-existing trademarks already registered by Burger King
and its then corporate parent [Pillsbury](Pillsbury_Company "wikilink")
that could be used to name the Australian restaurants.

Cowin selected the "Hungry Jack" brand name, one of Pillsbury's U.S.
pancake mixture products, and slightly changed the name to a possessive
form by adding an
[apostrophe](apostrophe#Possessive_apostrophe "wikilink") and "s" to
form the new name "Hungry Jack's". The first Australian franchise of
Burger King Corporation was established in
[Innaloo](Innaloo,_Western_Australia "wikilink"),
[Perth](Perth,_Western_Australia "wikilink"), on 18 April 1971, under
the auspices of Cowin's new company Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd.

By the end of its first decade of operation in the 1970s, Hungry Jack's
had expanded to 26 stores in three states. In October 1981, the company
opened its first [New South Wales](New_South_Wales "wikilink") store in
the [Sydney central business
district](Sydney_central_business_district "wikilink") on the corner of
[Liverpool](Liverpool_Street,_Sydney "wikilink") and [George
Street](George_Street,_Sydney "wikilink"). In 1986, the chain entered
[Victoria](Victoria_(Australia) "wikilink") by purchasing 11 stores from
the ailing [Wendy's Hamburger](Wendy's "wikilink") chain, later
converting them to Hungry Jack's.

### 1996 to 2001: legal battle with Burger King

In 1991, Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd. renewed its [franchise
agreement](franchise_agreement "wikilink") with Burger King Corporation
which allowed the Hungry Jack's to license third party franchisee.
However, one of the conditions of the agreement was that Hungry Jack's
had to open a certain number of stores every year for the term of the
contract. In 1996, shortly after the [Australian
trademark](Australian_trademark_law "wikilink") on the Burger King name
lapsed, Burger King Corporation made a claim that Hungry Jack's had
violated the conditions of the renewed franchise agreement by failing to
expand the chain at the rate defined in the contract and sought to
terminate the agreement.

Under the aegis of this claim, Burger King Corporation in partnership
with [Shell Australia](Shell_Australia "wikilink"), began to open its
own stores in 1997 beginning in [Sydney](Sydney "wikilink") and
throughout the Australian regions of [New South
Wales](New_South_Wales "wikilink"), [Australian Capital
Territory](Australian_Capital_Territory "wikilink"),
[Victoria](Victoria_(Australia) "wikilink") and
[Tasmania](Tasmania "wikilink"). In addition, Burger King
sought to limit HJ's ability to open new locations in the country,
whether they were corporate locations or third-party licensees.

As a result of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jack's owner Jack Cowin and
his company Competitive Foods Australia, began legal proceedings in 2001
against the Burger King Corporation, claiming Burger King Corporation
had violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was
in breach of the contract. The [Supreme Court of New South
Wales](Supreme_Court_of_New_South_Wales "wikilink") agreed with Cowin
and determined that Burger King had violated the terms of the contract
and awarded Hungry Jack's [A$](A$ "wikilink")46.9 million
(US$41.6 million in 2001).

In its decision, the Court said that Burger King sought to engineer a
default of the franchise agreement so that the company could limit the
number of new Hungry Jack's branded restaurants and ultimately claim the
Australian market as its own, which was a purpose that was extraneous to
the agreement. The case introduced the American legal concept of
[good faith](Good_faith_(law) "wikilink") negotiations into the
Australian legal system, which until the time of the verdict had been
rarely used in the Australian court systems.

### 2002 to present

After Burger King Corporation lost the case, it decided to terminate its
operations in the country and in July 2002 the company transferred its
assets to its New Zealand franchise group, Trans-Pacific Foods
(TPF). The terms of the sale had TPF assume oversight of the
Burger King franchises in the region as the Burger King brand's master
franchisee. Trans-Pacific Foods administered the chain's 81
locations until September 2003 when the new management team of Burger
King Corporation reached an agreement with Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd. to
[rebrand](Rebranding "wikilink") the existing Burger King locations to
Hungry Jack's and make Hungry Jack's Pty the sole master franchisee of
both brands.

An additional part of the agreement required Burger King Corporation to
provide administrative and advertising support as to ensure a common
marketing scheme for the company and its products. Trans-Pacific
Foods transferred its control of the Burger King franchises to Hungry
Jack's Pty Ltd., which subsequently renamed the remaining Burger King
locations as "Hungry Jack's," joining the other 210 outlets at the
time.

In the 2009 to 2010 financial year, Competitive Foods Australia reported
an after-tax profit of $32.1 million on sales of $1.043 billion.

As of September 2021, Hungry Jack's has 440 stores, with 75% being
company owned. The company intends to open more than 20 new stores
per year in the future, with an upper aim of 700 stores in total.

## Products

The only Burger King trademarks that are currently sold at Hungry Jack's
are the [Whopper](Whopper "wikilink") range of beef burgers and the
[TenderCrisp](TenderCrisp "wikilink") range of chicken burgers. Other
products sold by Hungry Jack's include the Baconator, the
[Brekky](Breakfast "wikilink") Wrap range and the Grill Masters premium
[Angus](Aberdeen_Angus "wikilink") beef burger range, as well as more
generic items such as [cheeseburgers](cheeseburger "wikilink"), [chicken
nuggets](chicken_nugget "wikilink"), and
[chips](French_fries "wikilink").

Hungry Jack's breakfast menu, introduced in late 2005 in two states,
[Queensland](Queensland "wikilink") and [Western
Australia](Western_Australia "wikilink"), as well as the [Northern
Territory](Northern_Territory "wikilink"), and the other states the
following year, bears little resemblance to Burger King's US breakfast
menu, and includes items such as [English
muffins](English_muffins "wikilink") and
[toasties](Grilled_cheese "wikilink"). In 2021 Hungry Jack's
released two new breakfast menu items, the Turkish Brekky BLAT and the
Turkish Brekky BLAT with egg. A [BLAT](BLT "wikilink") sandwich is
popular in Australia; the acronym stands for [Bacon](Bacon "wikilink"),
[Lettuce](Lettuce "wikilink"), [Avocado](Avocado "wikilink") and
[Tomato](Tomato "wikilink").

Due to the increase in popularity of plant-based [meat
alternatives](Meat_analogue "wikilink") being consumed across
Australia, Hungry Jack's introduced the "Rebel Whopper" in
partnership with [V2food](V2food "wikilink") in late 2019, which is a
variation of the Whopper containing a meat-free patty made with protein
extracted from [legumes](legume "wikilink"). A large
promotional campaign was run, including partnering with online creator
[Natalie Tran](Natalie_Tran "wikilink"). The restaurant also serves
a [vegan](vegan "wikilink") Whopper burger and English muffins, which
contain a vegetable patty.

In 2022, Hungry Jack's launched its Jack's Café coffee chain brand as a
response to [McDonald's](McDonald's "wikilink")
[McCafé](McCafé "wikilink") offering.

From November 2018, the full menu of Hungry Jack's was available for
home delivery via [Menulog](Menulog "wikilink").

### Big Jack

In mid-2020, the chain introduced the "Big Jack" burger, which is
essentially a slightly altered version of the [Big
King](Big_King "wikilink"), and similar to McDonald's [Big
Mac](Big_Mac "wikilink") burger. The close similarities in the name,
appearance and the marketing of the burger led to McDonald's suing
Hungry Jack's in the [Federal Court of
Australia](Federal_Court_of_Australia "wikilink") in August 2020 over
trademark infringement, and they sought to cancel Hungry Jack's Big Jack
trademark which was filed the previous year. They also accused the
company of deliberately copying the ingredients and appearance of the
Big Mac in bad faith.

In its defence, Hungry Jack's argued that the burger's name is simply a
play on the company's name and that of its founder Jack Cowin, and that
a burger's appearance and composition cannot be protected by a
[trademark](trademark "wikilink"), noting that their product features
"common characteristics of [hamburgers](hamburger "wikilink")" sold
everywhere. In November 2023, the Federal Court ruled against
McDonald's, finding that "Big Jack is not deceptively similar to Big
Mac", and that the company had not established that Hungry Jack's
trademarks had infringed on McDonald's existing trademarks. Hungry
Jack's had also ran an advertising campaign that made light of the
lawsuit during the early stages of the trial which also made the claim
that the Big Jack patty was 25% larger than the Big Mac's as a point of
differentiation; the Court found this claim misleading but it did not
affect the final verdict.

Hungry Jack's eventually released a number of variants of the burger to
the range, including a larger version — the Mega Jack, the Outlaw Big
Jack (which added bacon and [barbeque
sauce](barbeque_sauce "wikilink")), and the Chicken Big Jack. The burger
and all its variants were removed from the menu in late 2021.

## Marketing

### Logo

The Hungry Jack's logo is still based on the 1994 Burger King logo,
despite subsequent revisions to the logo used by Burger King in other
markets. The logo was redesigned in 2000, with the design based
on the 1999 Burger King logo, but the logo was never used.

### Sponsorship

Hungry Jack's currently sponsors the [West Coast
Eagles](West_Coast_Eagles "wikilink") and [Adelaide Football
Club](Adelaide_Football_Club "wikilink") in the [Australian Football
League](Australian_Football_League "wikilink") (AFL).
