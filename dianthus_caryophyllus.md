# Dianthus caryophyllus

***Dianthus caryophyllus***, commonly known as **carnation**
or **clove pink**, is a species of [Dianthus](Dianthus "wikilink")
native to the [Mediterranean region](Mediterranean_Basin "wikilink").
Its exact natural range is uncertain due to extensive cultivation over
the last 2,000 years. Carnations are prized for their vibrant colors,
delicate fringed petals, and enchanting fragrance.

The scent of carnations is often described as spicy, clove-like, or
reminiscent of a combination of cinnamon and nutmeg, hence the common
name "clove pink". This delightful aroma has made carnations a popular
choice for use in perfumes, [Potpourri](Potpourri "wikilink"), and
scented products.

They have cultural significance and are associated with love,
distinction, and motherly affection. With numerous cultivars and
hybrids, carnations offer a wide variety of colors and forms, making
them popular for gardens, floral arrangements, and scented products.
Overall, carnations are enduring symbols of beauty and grace, treasured
by flower enthusiasts and used to convey heartfelt emotions.

## Taxonomy

Carnations were mentioned in Greek literature 2,000 years ago. The term
dianthus was coined by Greek botanist
[Theophrastus](Theophrastus "wikilink"), and is derived from the
[Ancient Greek](Ancient_Greek "wikilink") words for divine ("dios") and
flower ("anthos"). The name "carnation" is believed to come from the
Latin , a "wreath, garland, chaplet, crown", as it was one of the
flowers used in Greek and Roman ceremonial crowns, or possibly from the
Latin ** (genitive **), "flesh", which refers to the natural colour
of the flower, or in Christian iconography incarnatio,
"[incarnation](incarnation "wikilink")", God made flesh in the form of
Jesus.

[Carl Linnaeus](Carl_Linnaeus "wikilink") described the carnation in
volume one of his *[Species Plantarum](Species_Plantarum "wikilink")* in
1753, giving it the name *Dianthus caryophyllus*.

Although originally applied to the species Dianthus caryophyllus, the
name carnation is also often applied to some of the other species of
[Dianthus](Dianthus "wikilink"), and more particularly to garden
[hybrids](Hybrid_(biology) "wikilink") between *D. caryophyllus* and
other species in the genus.

## Description

Dianthus caryophyllus is a [herbaceous](herbaceous "wikilink")
[perennial plant](perennial_plant "wikilink") growing up to tall. The
[leaves](leaf "wikilink") are [glaucous](glaucous "wikilink") greyish
green to blue-green, slender, up to long. The
[flowers](flower "wikilink") are produced singly or up to five together
in a [cyme](Inflorescence#Organization "wikilink"); they are around
diameter, and sweetly scented; the original natural flower color is
bright pinkish-purple, but [cultivars](cultivar "wikilink") of other
colors, including red, pink, yellow, white, and green have been
developed. While sometimes dyed blue for cut bouquets, there are no
known carnation cultivars that produce a true blue flower. The fragrant,
[hermaphrodite](hermaphrodite "wikilink") flowers have a radial
symmetry. The four to six surrounding the
[calyx](Calyx_(botany) "wikilink"), egg-shaped, sting-pointed scales
leaves are only ¼ as long as the calyx tube.

## Distribution and habitat

The wild carnation is found in the Mediterranean countries of
[Spain](Spain "wikilink"), [Italy](Italy "wikilink"),
[Croatia](Croatia "wikilink"), [Albania](Albania "wikilink"),
[Greece](Greece "wikilink") and [Turkey](Turkey "wikilink").

## Cultivation and uses

Carnations require well-drained, neutral to slightly alkaline soil, and
full sun. Numerous [cultivars](cultivar "wikilink") have been selected
for garden planting. Typical examples include 'Gina Porto', 'Helen',
'Laced Romeo', and 'Red Rocket'. They are used for medical purposes,
such as for upset stomach and fever. Their fragrance was historically
used for [vinegar](vinegar "wikilink"), beer, wine, sauces and
salads.

Crossbreeding D. caryophyllus with D. capitatus results in a hybrid
that is resistant to bacterial wilt from *[Paraburkholderia
caryophylli](Paraburkholderia_caryophylli "wikilink")*. However, the
flower is less attractive and so more breeding and backcrossing is
needed to improve the flower.

Carnation cultivars with no fragrance are often used by men as
[boutonnières](boutonnière "wikilink") or "buttonholes".

## Symbolism

### Traditional meanings

For the most part, carnations express love, fascination, and
distinction, though there are many variations dependent on color.

-   Along with the [red rose](Rose_(symbolism)#Socialism "wikilink"),
    the red carnation can be used as a symbol of
    [socialism](socialism "wikilink") and the [labour
    movement](labour_movement "wikilink"), and historically has often
    been used in demonstrations on [International Workers'
    Day](International_Workers'_Day "wikilink") ([May
    Day](May_Day "wikilink")).
-   In [China](China "wikilink"), the carnation flower is the most
    frequently used flower in weddings.
-   In [Portugal](Portugal "wikilink"), bright red carnations were used
    when in 1974 the authoritarian [Estado
    Novo](Estado_Novo_(Portugal) "wikilink") regime was overthrown;
    therefore, this transition (brought about by a combination of a
    coup d'état with [civil resistance](civil_resistance "wikilink"))
    is known as the [Carnation
    Revolution](Carnation_Revolution "wikilink").
-   Light red carnations represent admiration, while dark red denote
    deep love and affection.
-   White carnations represent pure love and good luck, while striped
    (variegated) carnations symbolise regret that a love cannot be
    shared.
-   In the [Netherlands](Netherlands "wikilink"), white carnations are
    associated with Prince Bernhard. He wore one during [World War
    II](World_War_II "wikilink") and in a gesture of defiance some of
    the Dutch population took up this gesture. After the war the white
    carnation became a sign of the Prince, veterans and remembrance of
    the resistance.
-   Purple carnations indicate capriciousness. In
    [France](France "wikilink"), it is a traditional funeral flower,
    given in condolence for the death of a loved one.
-   Carnation is the [birth flower](birth_flower "wikilink") for those
    born in the month of January.
-   Since Ottoman times, red carnations and [tulips](tulip "wikilink")
    are used in the interior wall paintings of
    [mosques](mosque "wikilink") in [Turkey](Turkey "wikilink"). It is
    often said that while tulips represent
    [God](God_in_Islam "wikilink"), carnations is the symbol for
    [Muhammad](Muhammad "wikilink"). However these flower designs are
    not unique to mosques but also used in many other Ottoman
    traditional art forms.
-   In [Azerbaijan](Azerbaijan "wikilink"), red carnations has turned
    into a symbol of mourning after the usage of the flower during
    [Black January](Black_January "wikilink") events of 1990, a violent
    crackdown on the civilian population of the country by USSR troops.
-   In the [United States](United_States "wikilink"), former U.S.
    President [William McKinley](William_McKinley "wikilink") considered
    the red carnation to be his lucky flower and often wore one on his
    lapel. Following his [assassination in
    1901](Assassination_of_William_McKinley "wikilink"), the [State of
    Ohio](Ohio "wikilink") adopted the red carnation as its [state
    flower](List_of_U.S._state_and_territory_flowers "wikilink") to
    honor McKinley

The formal name for carnation, dianthus, comes from Greek for
"heavenly flower", or the flower of [Jove](Jove "wikilink").

### Holidays and events

Carnations are often worn on special occasions, especially [Mother's
Day](Mother's_Day "wikilink") and weddings. In 1907, [Anna
Jarvis](Anna_Jarvis "wikilink") chose a carnation as the emblem of
Mother's Day because it was her mother's favourite flower. This
tradition is now observed in the United States and Canada on the second
Sunday in May. Ann Jarvis chose the white carnation because she wanted
to represent the purity of a mother's love. This meaning has
evolved over time, and now a red carnation may be worn if one's mother
is alive, and a white one if she has died.

In [Slovenia](Slovenia "wikilink"), red carnations are sometimes also
given to women on Women's Day, the 8th of March, however, nowadays
orchids or roses are often given as well.

In [Korea](Korea "wikilink"), carnations express admiration, love and
gratitude. Red and pink carnations are worn on [Parents
Day](Parents_Day "wikilink") (Korea does not separate Mother's Day or
Father's Day, but has Parents Day on 8 May). Sometimes, parents wear a
corsage of carnation(s) on their left chest on Parents Day. Carnations
are also worn on Teachers Day (15 May).

Red carnations are worn on [May
Day](International_Workers'_Day "wikilink") as a symbol of
[socialism](socialism "wikilink") and the [labour
movement](labour_movement "wikilink") in some countries, such as
[Austria](Austria "wikilink"), Italy, and successor countries of the
[former Yugoslavia](former_Yugoslavia "wikilink"). The red carnation is
also the symbol of the [Carnation
Revolution](Carnation_Revolution "wikilink") in
[Portugal](Portugal "wikilink").

Green carnations are for [St. Patrick's
Day](St._Patrick's_Day "wikilink") and were famously worn by the Irish
writer [Oscar Wilde](Oscar_Wilde "wikilink"). The green carnation thence
became a symbol of [homosexuality](homosexuality "wikilink") in the
early 20th century, especially through the book [The Green
Carnation](The_Green_Carnation "wikilink") and [Noël
Coward](Noël_Coward "wikilink")'s song, "We All Wear a Green Carnation"
in his [operetta](operetta "wikilink"), [Bitter
Sweet](Bitter_Sweet_(operetta) "wikilink").

In communist [Czechoslovakia](Czechoslovakia "wikilink") and in
[Poland](Poland "wikilink") in times of the [People's Republic of
Poland](People's_Republic_of_Poland "wikilink"), carnations were
traditionally given to women on the widely celebrated [Women's
Day](International_Women's_Day "wikilink"), together with commodities
that were difficult to obtain due to the countries' communist system,
such as [tights](tights "wikilink"), towels, [soap](soap "wikilink") and
[coffee](coffee "wikilink").

After the 1990 uprisings against Soviets in
[Azerbaijan](Azerbaijan "wikilink") in which 147 Azerbaijani civilians
were killed, 800 people were injured and five people went missing, the
carnation has become a symbol of the Black January tragedy associated
with the carnations thrown into the puddles of blood shed in the streets
of Azerbaijan subsequent to the massacre.

At the [University of Oxford](University_of_Oxford "wikilink"),
carnations are traditionally worn to all examinations; white for the
first exam, pink for exams in between, and red for the last exam. One
story explaining this tradition relates that initially a white carnation
was kept in a red inkpot between exams, so by the last exam it was fully
red; the story is thought to originate in the late 1990s.

Carnations are the traditional first wedding anniversary flower.

Carnations are also known as the "Flower of God". The Greek name for
Carnation is a fusion of "dios" and "anthos". Dios is used the described
Zeus while Anthos means flower; thus the name "flower of God" is
attached to it.

### Symbols of territorial entities and organizations

The carnation is the [national flower](national_flower "wikilink") of
[Spain](Spain "wikilink"), [Monaco](Monaco "wikilink"), and
[Slovenia](Slovenia "wikilink"), and the provincial flower of the
autonomous community of the [Balearic
Islands](Balearic_Islands "wikilink"). The [state
flower](List_of_U.S._state_flowers "wikilink") of
[Ohio](Ohio "wikilink") is a scarlet carnation, which was introduced to
the state by [Levi L. Lamborn](Levi_L._Lamborn "wikilink"). The choice
was made to honor [William McKinley](William_McKinley "wikilink"), Ohio
governor and U.S. president, who was assassinated in 1901, and regularly
wore a scarlet carnation on his lapel.

## Colours

Carnations do not naturally produce the pigment
[delphinidin](delphinidin "wikilink"), thus a blue carnation cannot
occur by [natural selection](natural_selection "wikilink") or be created
by traditional [plant breeding](plant_breeding "wikilink"). It shares
this characteristic with other widely sold flowers like
[roses](Hybrid_tea_rose "wikilink"), [lilies](Lilium "wikilink"),
[tulips](tulip "wikilink"), [chrysanthemums](chrysanthemum "wikilink")
and [gerberas](gerbera "wikilink").

Around 1996, a company, [Florigene](Florigene "wikilink"), used [genetic
engineering](genetic_engineering "wikilink") to extract certain genes
from [petunia](petunia "wikilink") and
[snapdragon](Antirrhinum "wikilink") flowers to produce a blue-mauve
carnation, which was commercialized as "Moondust". In 1998, a violet
carnation called "Moonshadow" was commercialized. As of 2004, three
additional blue-violet/purple varieties have been commercialized.
