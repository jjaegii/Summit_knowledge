# Jasminum sambac

***Jasminum sambac*** (**Arabian jasmine** or **Sambac jasmine**)
is a species of [jasmine](jasmine "wikilink") native to [tropical
Asia](tropical_Asia "wikilink"), from the Indian subcontinent to
Southeast Asia. It is cultivated in many places, especially [West
Asia](West_Asia "wikilink"), [South Asia](South_Asia "wikilink") and
[Southeast Asia](Southeast_Asia "wikilink"). It is naturalised in many
scattered locales: [Mauritius](Mauritius "wikilink"),
[Madagascar](Madagascar "wikilink"), the
[Maldives](Maldives "wikilink"), [Christmas
Island](Christmas_Island "wikilink"), [Chiapas](Chiapas "wikilink"),
Central America, southern [Florida](Florida "wikilink"), the
[Bahamas](Bahamas "wikilink"), [Cuba](Cuba "wikilink"),
[Hispaniola](Hispaniola "wikilink"), [Jamaica](Jamaica "wikilink"),
[Puerto Rico](Puerto_Rico "wikilink"), and the [Lesser
Antilles](Lesser_Antilles "wikilink").

*Jasminum sambac* is a small shrub or vine growing up to 0.5m to 3m 
(1.6 to 9.8 ft) in height. It
is widely cultivated for its attractive and sweetly fragrant flowers.
The flowers may be used as a fragrant ingredient in
[perfumes](perfume "wikilink") and [jasmine
tea](jasmine_tea "wikilink"). It is the [national
flower](national_flower "wikilink") of the
[Philippines](Philippines "wikilink"), where it is known as
***sampaguita**'', as well as being one of the three [national
flowers](List_of_Indonesian_floral_emblems "wikilink") of Indonesia,
where it is known as***melati putih**''.

## Description

*Jasminum sambac* is an [evergreen](evergreen "wikilink")
[vine](vine "wikilink") or [shrub](shrub "wikilink") reaching up to
0.5 to 3 m (1.6 to 9.8 ft) 
tall. The species is highly variable, possibly a result of
[spontaneous mutation](spontaneous_mutation "wikilink"), natural
[hybridization](Hybrid_(biology) "wikilink"), and
[autopolyploidy](Polyploid "wikilink"). Cultivated *Jasminum sambac*
generally do not bear seeds and the plant is reproduced solely by
[cuttings](Cutting_(plant) "wikilink"), [layering](layering "wikilink"),
[marcotting](marcotting "wikilink"), and other methods of [asexual
propagation](asexual_propagation "wikilink").

The leaves are [ovate](ovate_(leaf) "wikilink"), 4 to 12.5 cm
(1.6 to 4.9 in) long and 2 to 7.5 cm (0.79 to 2.95 in) wide. The
[phyllotaxy](phyllotaxy "wikilink") is opposite or in whorls of three,
simple (not [pinnate](pinnate "wikilink"), like most other
jasmines). They are smooth (glabrous) except for a few hairs at the
[venation](Leaf "wikilink") on the base of the leaf.

The flowers bloom all throughout the year and are produced in clusters
of 3 to 12 together at the ends of branches. They are strongly
scented, with a white corolla 2 to 3 cm (0.79 to 1.18 in) in diameter 
with 5 to 9 lobes. The flowers
open at night (usually around 6 to 8 in the evening), and close in the
morning, a span of 12 to 20 hours. The [fruit](fruit "wikilink") is
a purple to black [berry](berry_(botany) "wikilink") 1 cm (0.39 in) in 
diameter.


## Taxonomy and nomenclature

*Jasminum sambac* is classified under the [genus](genus "wikilink")
*[Jasminum](Jasminum "wikilink")* under the
[tribe](Tribe_(biology) "wikilink")
[Jasmineae](Jasmineae "wikilink"). It belongs to the
[olive](olive "wikilink") [family](Family_(biology) "wikilink")
[Oleaceae](Oleaceae "wikilink").

The English [common name](common_name "wikilink") of "Arabian jasmine",
*Jasminum sambac* is due to it being widely cultivated in Southwest of
[Saudi Arabia](Saudi_Arabia "wikilink"), [Yemen](Yemen "wikilink") and
[Oman](Oman "wikilink"). Early Chinese records of the plant points to
the origin of *Jasminum sambac* as eastern South Asia and Southeast
Asia. *Jasminum sambac* (and nine other species of the
[genus](genus "wikilink")) were [spread](Introduced_species "wikilink")
into [Arabia](Arabia "wikilink") and [Persia](Persia "wikilink") by man,
where they were cultivated in gardens. From there, they were introduced
to Europe where they were grown as ornamentals and were known under the
common name "sambac" in the 18th century.

The Medieval Arabic term *"zanbaq"* denoted jasmine flower-oil from the
flowers of any species of jasmine. This word entered late medieval Latin
as *"sambacus"* and *"zambacca"* with the same meaning as the Arabic,
and then in post-medieval Latin [plant
taxonomy](plant_taxonomy "wikilink") the word was adopted as a label for
the *J. sambac* species. The *J. sambac* species is a good source
for jasmine flower-oil in terms of the quality of the fragrance and it
continues to be cultivated for this purpose for the perfume industry
today. The *[Jasminum officinale](Jasminum_officinale "wikilink")*
species is also cultivated for the same purpose, and probably to a
greater extent.

In 1753, [Carl Linnaeus](Carl_Linnaeus "wikilink") first described the
plant as *[Nyctanthes](Nyctanthes "wikilink") sambac* in the first
edition of his famous book *[Systema
Naturae](Systema_Naturae "wikilink")*. In 1789, [William
Aiton](William_Aiton "wikilink") reclassified the plant to the genus
*[Jasminum](Jasminum "wikilink")*. He also coined the common English
name of "Arabian jasmine".

## Cultivation

The sweet, heady fragrance of *Jasminum sambac* is its distinct feature.
It is widely grown throughout the tropics from the [Arabian
peninsula](Arabian_peninsula "wikilink") to Southeast Asia and the
Pacific Islands as an ornamental plant and for its strongly scented
flowers. Numerous cultivars currently exist.

Typically, the flowers are harvested as [buds](bud "wikilink") during
early morning. The flower buds are harvested on basis of color, as
firmness and size are variable depending on the weather. The buds have
to be white, as green ones may not emit the characteristic fragrance
they are known for. Open flowers are generally not harvested as a
larger amount of them is needed to extract oils and they lose their
fragrance sooner.

*J. sambac* does not tolerate being frozen, so in temperate regions must
be grown under glass, in an unheated greenhouse or conservatory. It has
an intense fragrance which some people may find overpowering. In the UK
this plant has gained the [Royal Horticultural
Society](Royal_Horticultural_Society "wikilink")'s [Award of Garden
Merit](Award_of_Garden_Merit "wikilink").

### Cultivars

There are numerous [cultivars](cultivar "wikilink") of *Jasminum sambac*
which differ from each other by the shape of leaves and the structure of
the [corolla](Corolla_(flower) "wikilink"). The cultivars recognized
include:

-   **'Maid of Orleans**' – possesses flowers with a single layer of
    five or more oval shaped petals. It is the variety most commonly
    referred to as ***sampaguita**'' and***pikake**''. It is
    also known as 'Mograw', 'Motiya', or 'Bela'.
-   **'Belle of India**' – possesses flowers with a single or double
    layer of elongated petals.
-   **'Grand Duke of Tuscany**' – possesses flowers with a doubled petal
    count. They resemble small white [roses](rose "wikilink") and are
    less fragrant than the other varieties. It is also known as 'Rose
    jasmine' and 'Butt Mograw'. In the Philippines, it is known as
    ***kampupot***.
-   **'Mysore Mallige**' – resembles the 'Belle of India' cultivar but
    has slightly shorter petals with distinct and immense fragrance.
-   **'Arabian Nights**' – possesses a double layer of petals but is
    smaller in size than the 'Grand Duke of Tuscany' cultivar.

## Chemical composition

*Jasminum sambac* contains [dotriacontanoic
acid](dotriacontanoic_acid "wikilink"),
[dotriacontanol](dotriacontanol "wikilink"), [oleanolic
acid](oleanolic_acid "wikilink"), [daucosterol](daucosterol "wikilink"),
[hesperidin](hesperidin "wikilink"), and \[+\]-jasminoids A, B, C, D in
its roots. Leaves contains [flavonoids](flavonoid "wikilink") such as
[rutin](rutin "wikilink"), [quercetin](quercetin "wikilink") and
[isoquercetin](isoquercetin "wikilink"), flavonoids rhamnoglycosides as
well as [α-amyrin](α-amyrin "wikilink") and
[β-sitosterol](β-sitosterol "wikilink"). A novel plant
[cysteine](cysteine "wikilink")-rich [peptide](peptide "wikilink")
family named jasmintides were isolated from this plant.

Its aroma is caused by a variety of compounds including [benzyl
alcohol](benzyl_alcohol "wikilink"), tetradecamethylcycloheptasiloxane,
[methyl benzoate](methyl_benzoate "wikilink"),
[linalool](linalool "wikilink"), [benzyl
acetate](benzyl_acetate "wikilink"), (-)-(*R*)-jasmine lactone,
[(*E*,*E*)-α-farnesene](farnesene "wikilink"), (*Z*)-3-hexenyl benzoate,
N-acetylmethylanthranilate, dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, [(*E*)-methyl
jasmonate](methyl_jasmonate "wikilink"), [benzyl
benzoate](benzyl_benzoate "wikilink") and

## Importance

### Southeast Asia

#### Philippines

*Jasminum sambac* ([Filipino](Filipino_language "wikilink") and
[Philippine Spanish](Philippine_Spanish "wikilink"): *sampaguita*) was
adopted by the [Philippines](Philippines "wikilink") as the [national
flower](National_symbols_of_the_Philippines "wikilink") on 1 February
1934 via Proclamation No. 652 issued by
[American](American_Colonial_Period_(Philippines) "wikilink")
[Governor-General](Governor-General_of_the_Philippines#Insular_Government "wikilink")
[Frank Murphy](Frank_Murphy "wikilink"). 

Its most widespread modern common name "sampaguita" is derived from the
[Philippine Spanish](Philippine_Spanish "wikilink") *sampaguita*; from
[Tagalog](Tagalog_language "wikilink") *sampaga* ("jasmine", a direct
[loanword](loanword "wikilink") from the Indian
[sanskrit](sanskrit "wikilink") word *campaka*), and the Spanish
diminutive suffix *-ita*. It is also by native common names,
including *kampupot* in [Tagalog](Tagalog_language "wikilink");
*kulatai*, *pongso*, or *kampupot* in
[Kapampangan](Kapampangan_language "wikilink"); *manul* in the [Visayan
languages](Visayan_languages "wikilink"); *lumabi* or *malul* in
[Maguindanao](Maguindanao_language "wikilink"); and *hubar* or *malur*
in [Tausug](Tausug_language "wikilink").

[Filipinos](Filipino_people "wikilink") string the flowers into leis,
[corsages](corsage "wikilink"), and sometimes crowns. These
garlands are available as loose strings of blossoms or as tight clusters
of buds, and are commonly sold by vendors outside churches and near
street intersections.

Sampaguita garlands are used as a form of bestowing honour, veneration,
or accolade. These are primarily used to adorn religious images,
religious processions and photographs of the dead on altars. These are
placed around the necks of living persons such as dignitaries, visitors,
and occasionally to graduating students. Buds strung into ropes several
metres long are often used to decorate formal events such state
occasions at [Malacañang Palace](Malacañang_Palace "wikilink"),
weddings, and are sometimes used as the ribbon in [ribbon cutting
ceremonies](ribbon_cutting_ceremony "wikilink"). Though edible, the
flower is rarely used in cuisine, with an unusual example being
flavouring for ice cream.

*Jasminum sambac* is the subject of the [danza](danza "wikilink") song
*La Flor de Manila*, composed by [Dolores
Paterno](Dolores_Paterno "wikilink") in 1879. The song was popular
during the [Commonwealth](Commonwealth_of_the_Philippines "wikilink")
and is now regarded as a [romantic](romantic_music "wikilink")
classic. The flower is also the namesake of the song *El Collar de
Sampaguita*. The design of the ceremonial torch for the [2019 Southeast
Asian Games](2019_Southeast_Asian_Games "wikilink"), designed by
Filipino sculptor Daniel Dela Cruz, was inspired by the
sampaguita.

#### Indonesia

*Jasminum sambac* (Indonesian: melati putih) is one of the three [national
flowers](List_of_Indonesian_floral_emblems "wikilink") in
[Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink"), the other two being the [moon
orchid](Phalaenopsis_amabilis "wikilink") and the [giant
padma](Rafflesia_arnoldii "wikilink"). Although the official
adoption were announced only as recent as 1990 during World Environment
Day and enforced by law through Presidential Decree No. 4 in 1993,
the importance of *Jasminum sambac* in [Indonesian
culture](Indonesian_culture "wikilink") long predates its official
adoption. Since the formation of Indonesian republic during the reign of
[Sukarno](Sukarno "wikilink"), *melati putih* is always unofficially
recognized as the national flower of Indonesia. The reverence and its
elevated status mostly due to the importance of this flower in
Indonesian tradition [since ancient
times](History_of_Indonesia "wikilink").

It has long been considered a sacred flower in Indonesian tradition, as
it symbolizes purity, sacredness, and [sincerity](sincerity "wikilink").
It also represents the beauty of [modesty](modesty "wikilink"); a small
and simple white flower that can produce such sweet fragrance. It is
also the most prevalent flower in wedding ceremonies for ethnic
[Indonesians](Indonesians "wikilink"), especially in the island of
[Java](Java "wikilink"). Jasmine flower buds that have not fully
opened are usually picked to create strings of jasmine
[garlands](garland "wikilink") (). On wedding days, a traditional
[Javanese](Javanese_people "wikilink") or
[Sundanese](Sundanese_people "wikilink") bride's hair is adorned with
strings of jasmine garlands arranged as a hairnet to cover the *konde*
([hair bun](Bun_(hairstyle) "wikilink")). The intricately intertwined
strings of jasmine garlands are left to hang loose from the bride's
head. The groom's [kris](kris "wikilink") is also adorned with five
jasmine garlands called *roncen usus-usus* (intestine garlands) to refer
its intestine-like form and also linked to the legend of [Arya
Penangsang](Kris#Kris_Setan_Kober "wikilink"). In Makassar and
[Bugis](Bugis "wikilink") brides, the hair is also adorned with buds of
jasmine that resemble pearls. Jasmine is also used as floral offerings
for [hyangs](hyang "wikilink"), spirits and deities especially among
[Balinese](Balinese_people "wikilink")
[Hindu](Hinduism_in_Indonesia "wikilink"), and also often present during
funerals. In South Sumatran traditional costume, the *bungo melati*
pattern in [Palembang](Palembang "wikilink")
[songket](songket "wikilink") fabrics depicts the jasmine to represent
beauty and femininity.

The jasmine symbolizes a wide variety of things in Indonesian
traditions; it is the flower of life, beauty and festive wedding, yet it
is also often associated with spirits and death; the sudden scent of
jasmine is often an [ominous
sign](Wiktionary:ominous#adjective "wikilink") for the
[superstitious](Superstitions_in_Muslim_societies "wikilink"), as it may
herald the presence of a [ghost](:Category:Indonesian_ghosts "wikilink")
or [jinn](jinn#prevalence_of_belief "wikilink"). In Indonesian patriotic
songs and poems, the fallen *melati* is often the representation of
[fallen heroes](List_of_Indonesian_National_Heroes "wikilink") that
[sacrificed their lives and died for the
country](Indonesian_National_Revolution "wikilink"), a very similar
concept to fallen *[sakura](sakura "wikilink")* that represents fallen
heroes in Japanese tradition. [Ismail
Marzuki](Ismail_Marzuki "wikilink")'s patriotic song *"Melati di Tapal
Batas"* (jasmine on the border) (1947) and [Guruh
Sukarnoputra](Guruh_Sukarnoputra "wikilink")'s *"Melati Suci"*
(sacred jasmine) (1974) clearly refer jasmine as the representation of
fallen heroes, the eternally fragrant flower that adorned [Ibu
Pertiwi](Ibu_Pertiwi "wikilink") (Indonesian [national
personification](national_personification "wikilink")). Iwan
Abdurachman's *"Melati Dari Jayagiri"* (jasmine from Jayagiri mountain)
refers to jasmine as the representation of the pure unspoiled beauty of
a girl and also a long-lost love.

In Indonesia, [essential oils](essential_oil "wikilink") are extracted
from jasmine flowers and buds by using the [steam
distillation](steam_distillation "wikilink") process. Jasmine essential
oil is one of the most expensive [commodities](commodities "wikilink")
in the [aromatherapy](aromatherapy "wikilink") and [perfume
industry](perfume_industry "wikilink").

#### Cambodia

In [Cambodia](Cambodia "wikilink"), the flower is used as an offering to
the [Buddha](Buddha "wikilink"). During flowering season which begins in
June, Cambodians thread the flower buds onto a wooden needle to be
presented to the [Buddha](Buddha "wikilink").

#### Thailand

In [Thailand](Thailand "wikilink"), this flower is often strung into a
garland for offerings to Buddha. Its name is called in
[Thai](Thai_language "wikilink") as *"mali la"* (Thai: มะลิลา) or 
*"mali son"* (Thai: มะลิซ้อน).
Their names are referenced in [central folk
songs](music_of_Thailand "wikilink"), until it is widely known and
popular. It has been adapted into a sports song. In addition, the
flower is also used as a symbol on [Mother's
Day](Mother's_Day "wikilink") in Thailand as well which falls on August
12, birthday of [Queen Sirikit](Queen_Sirikit "wikilink").

### East Asia

#### China

In China, the flower (Chinese: 茉莉花; pinyin: Mòlì huā) is processed and used as the main flavoring
ingredient in [jasmine tea](jasmine_tea "wikilink") (茉莉花茶). It
is also the subject of a popular [folk song](folk_song "wikilink") *[Mo
Li Hua](Mo_Li_Hua "wikilink").*

### Hawaii

In Hawaii, the flower is known as *pīkake*, and is used to make fragrant
[leis](lei_(garland) "wikilink"). The name 'pīkake' is derived from
the Hawaiian word for "[peacock](peacock "wikilink")", because the
Hawaiian [Princess Kaʻiulani](Kaʻiulani "wikilink") was fond of both the
flowers and the bird.

### The Middle East

In [Oman](Oman "wikilink"), *Jasminum sambac* features prominently on a
child's first birthday. They are used to make thick garlands used as
hair adornments. Flowers are sprinkled on the child's head by other
children while chanting "hol hol". The fragrant flowers are also sold
packed in between large leaves of the Indian almond (*[Terminalia
catappa](Terminalia_catappa "wikilink")*) and sewn together with strips
of [date palm](date_palm "wikilink") leaves. In
[Bahrain](Bahrain "wikilink") The flower is made into a pin along with
the leaf of a palm tree to commemorate the martyrs of the country,
similar to the White Poppy flower.

### South Asia

Jasmine is considered to be a sacred flower in
[Hinduism](Hinduism "wikilink"). It is one of the most commonly grown
ornamentals in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, where it is
native. At Indian weddings, the bride often adorns her hair with
garlands made of mogra, either around a bun or wrapped across a braid.

#### Sri Lanka

In Sri Lanka it is widely known as *pichcha* or *gaeta pichcha*. The
name *sithapushpa* and *katarolu* are also used in older texts. The
flowers are used in Buddhist temples and in ceremonial garlands.

## Toxicity

The LD50 of jasmine extract is greater than 5 mg/kg by weight.
