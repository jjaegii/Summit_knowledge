# Lapis lazuli

**Lapis lazuli**, or **lapis** for short, is a deep-blue
[metamorphic rock](metamorphic_rock "wikilink") used as a [semi-precious
stone](Gemstone "wikilink") that has been prized since
[antiquity](ancient_history "wikilink") for its intense color.
Originating from the Persian word for the gem, *lāžward*,[1] lapis
lazuli is a rock composed primarily of the minerals
[lazurite](lazurite "wikilink"), [pyrite](pyrite "wikilink") and
[calcite](calcite "wikilink"). As early as the [7th millennium
BC](7th_millennium_BC "wikilink"), lapis lazuli was mined in the [Sar-i
Sang](Sar-i_Sang "wikilink") mines,[2] in
[Shortugai](Shortugai "wikilink"), and in other mines in
[Badakhshan](Badakhshan "wikilink") province in modern northeast
[Afghanistan](Afghanistan "wikilink").[3] Lapis lazuli artifacts, dated
to 7570 BC, have been found at [Bhirrana](Bhirrana "wikilink"), which is
the oldest site of [Indus Valley
civilisation](Indus_Valley_civilisation "wikilink").[4] Lapis was highly
valued by the Indus Valley Civilisation (7570–1900 BC).[5][6][7] Lapis
beads have been found at [Neolithic](Neolithic "wikilink") burials in
[Mehrgarh](Mehrgarh "wikilink"), the [Caucasus](Caucasus "wikilink"),
and as far away as [Mauritania](Mauritania "wikilink").[8] It was used
in the [funeral mask of Tutankhamun](Tutankhamun's_mask "wikilink")
(1341–1323 BC).[9]

By the end of the [Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink"), lapis lazuli
began to be exported to Europe, where it was ground into powder and made
into the pigment, [ultramarine.](ultramarine "wikilink") Ultramarine was
used by some of the most important artists of the
[Renaissance](Renaissance "wikilink") and [Baroque](Baroque "wikilink"),
including [Masaccio](Masaccio "wikilink"),
[Perugino](Perugino "wikilink"), [Titian](Titian "wikilink") and
[Vermeer](Vermeer "wikilink"), and was often reserved for the clothing
of the central figures of their paintings, especially the [Virgin
Mary](Virgin_Mary "wikilink"). Ultramarine has also been found in
[dental tartar](dental_tartar "wikilink") of
[medieval](Middle_Ages "wikilink") [nuns](nuns "wikilink") and
[scribes](scribes "wikilink"), perhaps as a result of licking their
painting brushes while producing medieval texts and manuscripts.[10]

## Major sources

Mines in northeast Afghanistan continue to be a major source of lapis
lazuli. Important amounts are also produced from mines west of [Lake
Baikal](Lake_Baikal "wikilink") in Russia, and in the
[Andes](Andes "wikilink") mountains in [Chile](Chile "wikilink") which
is the source that the [Inca](Inca "wikilink") used to carve artifacts
and jewelry. Smaller quantities are mined in Pakistan, Italy, Mongolia,
the United States, and Canada.[11]

## Etymology

Lapis is the [Latin](Latin "wikilink") word for "stone" and is the
[genitive](genitive "wikilink") form of the [Medieval
Latin](Medieval_Latin "wikilink") , which is taken from the
[Arabic](Arabic_language "wikilink") , itself from the
[Persian](Persian_language "wikilink") and/or . It means "sky" or
"heaven"; so this is a "stone (of/from) the sky" or "stone (of/from)
heaven".[12] For example, in the following [Persian
poem](Persian_literature#Poetry "wikilink") by
[Ferdowsi](Ferdowsi "wikilink"):

As the sun struck the dome of lazuli,  
A golden curtain was drawn, most truly.

Historically, it was mined in the [Badakhshan](Badakhshan "wikilink")
region of upper Afghanistan. is etymologically related to the color
blue, and used as a root for the word for blue in several languages,
including Spanish and Portuguese as well as English .[13][14]

## Science and uses

### Composition

The most important mineral component of lapis lazuli is
[lazurite](lazurite "wikilink")[15] (25% to 40%), a blue
[feldspathoid](feldspathoid "wikilink") [silicate
mineral](silicate_mineral "wikilink") of the sodalite family, with the
formula .[16] Most lapis lazuli also contains
[calcite](calcite "wikilink") (white), and [pyrite](pyrite "wikilink")
(metallic yellow). Some samples of lapis lazuli contain
[augite](augite "wikilink"), [diopside](diopside "wikilink"),
[enstatite](enstatite "wikilink"), [mica](mica "wikilink"),
[hauynite](hauynite "wikilink"), [hornblende](hornblende "wikilink"),
[nosean](nosean "wikilink"), and sulfur-rich
[löllingite](löllingite "wikilink") *geyerite*.

Lapis lazuli usually occurs in crystalline [marble](marble "wikilink")
as a result of [contact metamorphism](contact_metamorphism "wikilink").

### Color

The intense blue color is due to the presence of the
[trisulfur](trisulfur "wikilink") [radical
anion](radical_anion "wikilink") () in the crystal.[17] The presence of
disulfur () and tetrasulfur () radicals can shift the color towards
yellow or red, respectively.[18] These radical anions substitute for the
chloride anions within the [sodalite](sodalite "wikilink")
structure.[19] The radical anion exhibits a visible absorption band in
the range 595–620 nm with high molar absorptivity, leading to its bright
blue color.[20]

### Sources

Lapis lazuli is found in limestone in the [Kokcha
River](Kokcha_River "wikilink") valley of
[Badakhshan](Badakhshan "wikilink") province in north-eastern
Afghanistan, where the [Sar-i Sang](Sar-i_Sang "wikilink") mine deposits
have been worked for more than 6,000 years.[21] Afghanistan was the
source of lapis for the ancient Persian, Egyptian and Mesopotamian
civilizations, as well as the later Greeks and Romans. Ancient Egyptians
obtained the material through trade with Mesopotamians, as part of
[Egypt–Mesopotamia relations](Egypt–Mesopotamia_relations "wikilink").
During the height of the [Indus Valley
civilisation](Indus_Valley_civilisation "wikilink"), approximately 2000
BC, the Harappan colony, now known as [Shortugai](Shortugai "wikilink"),
was established near the lapis mines.[22]

In addition to the Afghan deposits, lapis is also extracted in the
[Andes](Andes "wikilink") (near [Ovalle](Ovalle,_Chile "wikilink"),
[Chile](Chile "wikilink")); and to the west of [Lake
Baikal](Lake_Baikal "wikilink") in Siberia, Russia, at the Tultui
lazurite deposit. It is mined in smaller amounts in
[Angola](Angola "wikilink"), Argentina, [Burma](Burma "wikilink"),
Pakistan, Canada, Italy, India, and in the United States in
[California](California "wikilink") and
[Colorado](Colorado "wikilink").[23]

### Uses and substitutes

Lapis takes an excellent polish and can be made into jewellery,carvings,
boxes, [mosaics](mosaic "wikilink"), ornaments, small statues, and
vases. Interior items and finishing buildings can be also made with
lapis. Two of the columns framing the
[iconostasis](iconostasis "wikilink") in [Saint Isaac's
Cathedral](Saint_Isaac's_Cathedral "wikilink") in [Saint
Petersburg](Saint_Petersburg "wikilink") are built with lapis. During
the [Renaissance](Renaissance "wikilink"), lapis was ground and
processed to make the [pigment](pigment "wikilink")
[ultramarine](ultramarine "wikilink") for use in
[frescoes](fresco "wikilink") and [oil
painting](oil_painting "wikilink"). Its usage as a pigment in oil paint
largely ended during the early 19th century, when a chemically identical
synthetic variety became available.

Lapis lazuli is commercially synthesized or simulated by the Gillson
process, which is used to make artificial
[ultramarine](ultramarine "wikilink") and [hydrous](Hydrate "wikilink")
[zinc phosphates](Zinc_phosphate "wikilink").[24]
[Spinel](Spinel "wikilink") or [sodalite](sodalite "wikilink"), or dyed
[jasper](jasper "wikilink") or [howlite](howlite "wikilink"), can be
substituted for lapis.[25]

## History and art

### In the ancient world

Lapis lazuli has been mined in Afghanistan and exported to the
Mediterranean world and South Asia since the
[Neolithic](Neolithic "wikilink") age,[26][27] along the ancient trade
route between Afghanistan and the [Indus
Valley](Indus_Valley "wikilink") dating to the 7th millennium BC.
Quantities of these beads have also been found at 4th millennium BC
settlements in Northern [Mesopotamia](Mesopotamia "wikilink"), and at
the [Bronze Age](Bronze_Age "wikilink") site of [Shahr-e
Sukhteh](Shahr-e_Sukhteh "wikilink") in southeast Iran (3rd millennium
BC). A dagger with a lapis handle, a bowl inlaid with lapis, amulets,
beads, and inlays representing eyebrows and beards, were found in the
Royal Tombs of the Sumerian city-state of [Ur](Ur "wikilink") from the
3rd millennium BC.[28]

Lapis was also used in ancient Persia, Mesopotamia by the
[Akkadians](Akkadians "wikilink"), [Assyrians](Assyria "wikilink"), and
[Babylonians](Babylonians "wikilink") for
[seals](Cylinder_seal "wikilink") and jewelry. It is mentioned several
times in the Mesopotamian poem, the [Epic of
Gilgamesh](Epic_of_Gilgamesh "wikilink") (17th–18th century BC), one of
the oldest known works of literature. The [Statue of
Ebih-Il](Statue_of_Ebih-Il "wikilink"), a 3rd millennium BC statue found
in the ancient city-state of [Mari](Mari,_Syria "wikilink") in
modern-day [Syria](Syria "wikilink"), now in the
[Louvre](Louvre "wikilink"), uses lapis lazuli inlays for the irises of
the eyes.[29]

In ancient Egypt, lapis lazuli was a favorite stone for amulets and
ornaments such as [scarabs](Scarab_(artifact) "wikilink"). Lapis
jewellery has been found at excavations of the [Predynastic
Egyptian](Predynastic_Egypt "wikilink") site [Naqada](Naqada "wikilink")
(3300–3100 BC). At [Karnak](Karnak "wikilink"), the relief carvings of
[Thutmose III](Thutmose_III "wikilink") (1479–1429 BC) show fragments
and barrel-shaped pieces of lapis lazuli being delivered to him as
tribute. Powdered lapis was used as eyeshadow by
[Cleopatra](Cleopatra "wikilink").[30][31]

Jewelry made of lapis lazuli has also been found at
[Mycenae](Mycenae "wikilink") attesting to relations between the
Myceneans and the developed civilizations of Egypt and the East.[32]

[Pliny the Elder](Pliny_the_Elder "wikilink") wrote that lapis lazuli is
"opaque and sprinkled with specks of gold".  Because the stone combines
the blue of the heavens and golden glitter of the sun, it was emblematic
of success in the old Jewish tradition. In the early Christian tradition
lapis lazuli was regarded as the stone of [Virgin
Mary](Mary,_mother_of_Jesus "wikilink").

In late classical times and as late as the Middle Ages, lapis lazuli was
often called [sapphire](sapphire "wikilink") (*sapphirus* in Latin,
*sappir* in Hebrew),[33] though it had little to do with the stone today
known as the blue [corundum](corundum "wikilink") variety sapphire. In
his book on stones, the Greek scientist
[Theophrastus](Theophrastus "wikilink") described "the sapphirus, which
is speckled with gold," a description which matches lapis lazuli.[34]

There are many references to "sapphire" in the [Old
Testament](Old_Testament "wikilink"), but most scholars agree that,
since sapphire was not known before the Roman Empire, they most likely
are references to lapis lazuli. For instance, Exodus 24:10: "And they
saw the God of Israel, and there was under his feet as it were a paved
work of a sapphire stone..." (KJV). The words used in the Latin Vulgate
Bible in this citation are "quasi opus lapidis sapphirini", the terms
for lapis lazuli.[35] Modern translations of the Bible, such as the New
Living Translation Second Edition,[36] refer to lapis lazuli in most
instances instead of sapphire.

### Vermeer

[Johannes Vermeer](Johannes_Vermeer "wikilink") used lapis lazuli paint,
in the *[Girl with a Pearl
Earring](Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring "wikilink")* painting.[37][38]

### Yeats

The poet, [William Butler Yeats](W._B._Yeats "wikilink"), describes a
figurine of sculpted lapis lazuli in a poem entitled "Lapis Lazuli". The
sculpture of three men from China, a bird, and a musical instrument
serves in the poem as a reminder of "gaiety" in the face of tragedy.[39]
