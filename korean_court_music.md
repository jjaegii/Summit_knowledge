# Korean court music

**Korean court music** (Kor: 궁중음악, RR: gungjung eumak) comprises
three main musical genres: *[aak](aak "wikilink")*, an imported form of
Chinese ritual music; a pure Korean form called
*[hyangak](hyangak "wikilink")*; and a combination of Chinese and Korean
styles called *[dangak](dangak "wikilink")*.[1]

Korean court music and its historical origins can be traced back to the
[Three Kingdoms Period](Three_Kingdoms_of_Korea "wikilink") (57
BCE–668), the [Unified Silla](Unified_Silla "wikilink") (668–935),
[Goryeo](Goryeo "wikilink") (918–1392) and
[Joseon](Joseon_dynasty "wikilink") dynasties (1392–1910).[2][3] It was
partly modelled on the court music of [China](China "wikilink"), known
as *[yayue](yayue "wikilink")*. Korean court music also shows
similarities with the court music of [Japan](Japan "wikilink"), known as
*[gagaku](gagaku "wikilink")* and of [Vietnam](Vietnam "wikilink"),
known as *[nhã nhạc](nhã_nhạc "wikilink")*, which also are also
derivative of yayue.

Performances in the form of banquet dances typically accompany the court
music, in which musical institutions play a role in teaching and
training musicians and performers on the forms of traditional Korean
dance. The instruments used in Korean court music vary depending on the
specific genre but do show various overlaps between the three different
types. Traditional court music also continues to show significant
cultural influence on contemporary society in [South
Korea](South_Korea "wikilink"), through government, national music
associations, and forms of popular culture such as [South Korean
music.](Music_of_South_Korea "wikilink")

## History

Korean court music and its origins have been traced as early as the
[Unified Silla](Unified_Silla "wikilink") period (668–935); however, the
three categories commonly began their spread across Korea during the
[Goryeo dynasty](Goryeo "wikilink") (918–1392), mainly due to Chinese
influence.[4]

### *Aak*

The genre of *[aak](aak "wikilink")* refers to Korean court ritual music
originating from China.[5] *Aak* means 'elegant music'. It is similar to
*dangak* as both genres are of Chinese origin. The types of Chinese
court music within the *aak* genre included Korean royal processional
music, referred to as *[daechwita](daechwita "wikilink")*; *munmyo
jeryeak*, Confucian shrine music; j*ongmyo jeryeak*, also known as royal
ancestral shrine music; *hyangak* and *[gagok](gagok "wikilink")*,
translated to the 'classical song cycle'; and *dangak*.[6] As these
forms of court music eventually began to fade away, *aak* was decidedly
later used only for Confucian shrine music. As time went on, it
eventually also included forms of music played for aristocrats, nobility
and court officials.

The first historical noting of *aak* was during the Unified Silla period
of 668–935; however, this is only due to the existence of *aak*
instruments, and no music or performance coexisted at this time.[7]
*Aak* music and performance to began to spread across Korea for the
first time during the [Goryeo](Goryeo "wikilink") dynasty of 918–1392.
*Aak* was first introduced to Korea during 1116, when the Chinese
emperor of the Sung dynasty first presented the Korean court with *aak*
instruments and court dance instructions; [Emperor Hyejong of
Goryeo](Hyejong_of_Goryeo "wikilink") provided [Emperor Huizong of
Song](Emperor_Huizong_of_Song "wikilink") with a gift of 428 music
instruments, 572 costumes, and ritual dance objects imported from
China.[8] This created the growth in popularity for *aak* within Korea;
however, the genre saw an eventual decline afterwards. The [Yi
dynasty](House_of_Yi "wikilink") during 1392–1910 then allowed for a
completely finalised version of the *aak* system to rise across Korea,
as the year 1430 saw the revival of the genre through a more modern
reconstruction of traditional *aak* melodies.[9]

Instruments used within the genre are all of Chinese origin and are
mostly used for the purpose of playing *aak* music, as opposed to being
used for other genres of traditional court music.[10]

There are only two current surviving melodies of *aak*, both of which
are played very slowly, and last around four minutes. Each piece
contains 32 notes, and each note is played for at least four seconds,
with the instruments rising in pitch at the end of every note.[11]

### *Hyangak*

The genre of *[hyangak](hyangak "wikilink")* refers to court banquet
music originating from [Korea](Korea "wikilink").[12] *Hyangak* means
*'indigenous/native music, folk music*'. During the Unified Silla period
of Korea, the genre widely included native Korean court music, along
with music imported from China prior to the years of the [Tang
dynasty](Tang_dynasty "wikilink"). As *hyangak* includes original Korean
music, it is commonly acknowledged as the most prominent genre of court
music, and its wider musical range has also led to the preference of
Koreans to perform it more frequently than other genres.[13]

Its historical origins trace as far back to the [Three Kingdoms
period](Three_Kingdoms "wikilink") (220 AD – 280 AD).[14] However, the
earliest recordings of *hyangak* were during the 14th century, which was
seen through the very first few creations of instrumental *hyangak*
compositions. The 15th century started to see the creation of 24
*hyangak* compositions in total, and by the year 1434, there were around
80 compositions of hyangak music. During the Unified Silla period of
Korea, *hyangak* was only played alongside *dangak*. Within the Goryeo
dynasty, *hyangak* was referred to instead as *sokak*. Some of the
genre's musical instruments were derived from the Unified Silla period,
including the *samhyeon* and *samjook*; however, *hyangak* was also
played with foreign instruments such as the
*[janggu](janggu "wikilink")*, *[haegeum](haegeum "wikilink")* and the
daegeum. The Joseon dynasty finally saw less of a clear distinction
between *hyangak* and *dangak* through each genre's direct influence on
one another.[15]

*Dangak* music is typically accompanied with folk dance performances
referred to as *hyangak chongjae*.[16]

One of the most important *hyangak* pieces is referred to as
*[yeomillak](yeomillak "wikilink")*. Other *hyangak* pieces include
*pollyeong*, *haeryeong*, and b*oheoja*, all of which are performed in
Chinese style.

### *Dangak*

The genre of *[dangak](dangak "wikilink")* refers to Chinese court
banquet music in Korea. *Dangak* means 'Tang music', as the genre was
initially used for Chinese court music which originated during the Tang
dynasty. However, during the Goryeo dynasty, *dangak* was then used to
refer to music imported from China both during and after the Tang
dynasty. The genre was then split into *ubangak*; music of the right,
and *hyangak*; music of the left.[17]

*Dangak* originated within the Goryeo dynasty of 918–1392, in which
*dangak* music and performances first began to spread across Korea.
During the Yi dynasty of 1392–1910, the genre further developed through
an increase in the creation of compositions for instrumental *dangak*
music. *Dangak* continued to spread in Korea throughout the Goryeo
(918–1392) and Joseon (1392–1910) dynasties.[18]

*Dangak* music is typically accompanied with dance performances referred
to as *dangak chongjae*.[19]

One of the most popular pieces of *dangak* is commonly known as
*Nakyangchun*, and is one of the two only current surviving pieces of
*dangak* music, of which the other is *[Boheoja](Boheoja "wikilink")*
(translated to "Pacing the Void").[20]

## Performance

Korean court performances included traditional banquet dances alongside
musical accompaniments. Female court entertainers were called *kinyo*
and *[kisaeng](kisaeng "wikilink")*. Male musicians were separated into
four different classes: *aksaeng*, *aggong*, *kwanhyon maengin*, and
*royal processional musicians*.[21]

### *Aak*

The first recorded performance of *aak* was at the Royal Ancestral
Shrine during the Goryeo period of Korea.

Modern *aak* musical performances are known as *munmyo jeryeak* or
*jongmyo jeryeak*, which contain two instrumental ensembles; the
"terrace" group who play on the porch of the main shrine, and the
"courtyard" group, who play near the main entrance of the main
shrine.[22]

This is typically accompanied by modern dance performances known as
*munmyo ilmu*, which contains two types of dances; a "civil" dance, or a
"military" dance, in which 64 dancers perform in an 8 × 8 formation.[23]

Audiences are welcome to watch *aak* performances at the National Gugak
Center in Seoul.[24] Performances are also played at certain ceremonies
such as the [Seokjeon Daeje](Seokjeon_Daeje "wikilink"), held at the
Munmyo shrine of the [Sungkyunkwan
University](Sungkyunkwan_University "wikilink") in
[Seoul](Seoul "wikilink"). This festival is held during the spring and
autumn seasons every year as a festival with the purpose to honour
[Confucius](Confucius "wikilink").[25]

### *Hyangak chongjae*

*Hyangak chongjae* described banquet dances which were performed
alongside *hyangak* instrumental music. The dance required musicians and
entertainers to enter the stage alongside the beat of *hyangak* music.
The entertainers would then pause their dancing, to sing Korean poems.
Finally, performers would exit the stage after bowing, which concluded
the performance.[26]

### *Dangak chongjae*

*Dangak chongjae* described banquet dances which were performed
alongside *dangak* instrumental music. The dance required musicians and
entertainers to enter the stage behind pole bearers. The dancers would
then read Chinese poems. Finally, performers would exit the stage,
concluding the performance.[27] Musicians and performers of *dangak
chongjae* were normally drawn from the lower classes of Korea.[28]

### Court music institutions

Court music institutions also play a heavy role in assisting musicians
with their learning processes of Korean court performances.

The first modern theatre built by the royal court was referred to as
*Hyuomnyulsa*. The theatre has since changed its name to *Wongaksa*.[29]

Currently, court music institutions include the [National Center for
Korean Traditional Performing Arts](National_Gugak_Center "wikilink")
and the Chongdong Theater, which foster the preservation and
appreciation of traditional court music within contemporary society.[30]

## Instruments used

The instruments used in Korean court music vary depending on the
specific genre; however, they also show various overlaps between the
three categories of *aak*, *hyangak* and *dangak*.

### *Aak*

Instruments used for *aak* may include the *tungga*, *honga*,
*[pyeonjong](pyeonjong "wikilink")*,

## Cultural influence on contemporary society

The word for music in the Korean language is e*umak*, which very closely
resembles the word for the traditional Korean court music form
*aak*.[34] In [North Korea](North_Korea "wikilink"), traditional court
music and performances have mostly died out as a result of the nation's
strong political ideologies. However, traces of its legacy have
continued to live on within [South Korean](South_Korea "wikilink")
culture and as a result, continues to cultivate cultural influence on
contemporary South Korean society.

### National institutions and associations

The South Korean government advocates for the preservation of
traditional court music within contemporary society. National music
institutions such as the [National Center for Korean Traditional
Performing Arts](National_Gugak_Center "wikilink") and the Chongdong
Theater, along with associations such as the Korean Music Association
and the Korean Vocal Music Association, also contribute to fostering the
sustained appreciation of Korean court music within current and future
generations.[35]

### Contemporary South Korean music

Popular Korean musicians have also drawn upon Korean court music as
sources of inspiration for their songs, such as BTS' Agust D. Agust D's
"Daechwita" is heavily inspired by and directly named after and samples
the Korean royal processional music genre.[36]
