# Shogun (novel)

[James Clavell’s](James_Clavell "wikilink") ***Shōgun*** is a 1975 novel
fictionalizing incidents and personages in 17th century [feudal
Japan](feudal_Japan "wikilink") effecting the [Edo
period’s](Edo_period "wikilink") advent. The third published, and the
first chronologically placed, book in Clavell's six-volume *[Asian
Saga](Asian_Saga "wikilink"),* by 1980 it sold six million copies
worldwide. It has been made into two TV miniseries
((Shōgun_(1980_miniseries) "wikilink") and
(Shōgun_(2024_miniseries) "wikilink")), a [stage
musical](Shōgun:_The_Musical "wikilink"), as well as one board game and
three video games.

## Premise

*Shogun* portrays, in close parallel to actual history, a disunited 1600
feudal Japan without a [Shogun](Shogun "wikilink") (central ruler) for
nearly three decades rent by dynastic clashes and competing factions;
both domestic, and more recently from [Portugal](Portugal "wikilink")
and [Holland](Holland "wikilink"). Clavell fictionalizes historical
events and figures during the months before the [Battle of
Sekigahara](Battle_of_Sekigahara "wikilink")—pivotal to the [Shogunate
restoration](Tokugawa_shogunate "wikilink")—and the battle’s immediate
aftermath.

## Plot

The [Dutch](Dutch_people "wikilink") *Erasmus* has been secretly sent to
Japan to take over Portugal's lucrative East Asian trade, but having
lost many lives, including its captain, it ends up in
[Izu](Izu,_Shizuoka "wikilink") harbor marooned.

The first Northern Europeans to reach Japan, the surviving Dutch crew
with its English pilot John Blackthorne are captured by Izu's
*[daimyō](daimyō "wikilink")* (lord) Yabu. After seizing the "barbarian"
ship's records, armaments and coin, Yabu relinquishes them to his liege
Toranaga, Lord of the [Kantō](Kantō_region "wikilink") and President of
the Council of Regents, who sees the ship as an advantage against Lord
Ishido, his chief rival in the factional Council. Blackthorne is the
sole crew member brought to Osaka and presented to Toranaga.

Toranaga questions Blackthorne while a Portuguese Jesuit accurately
translates despite the [Protestant](Protestantism "wikilink") revealing
that [Catholic](Catholic_Church "wikilink") Portugal and [Elizabethan
England](Elizabethan_era "wikilink") are at war, making Toranaga realize
divisions among Christians that were previously hidden.

To keep him from Ishido, Blackthorne is imprisoned with a Franciscan
friar who teaches Blackthorne rudimentary Japanese and of how the
[Jesuits’](Jesuits "wikilink") [ronin](Rōnin "wikilink") (mercenaries)
launched violent agitations inside Japan to profit the Portuguese Crown
at Japan's expense. Before the two Catholic Regents can execute him,
Blackthorne is snatched in transit and returned to Toranaga.

Lady Toda Mariko, a Jesuit educated Catholic loyal to Toranaga; not her
church, faithfully translates to Toranaga Blackthorne’s account of the
Pope granting Portugal [colonial rights to Japan and East
Asia](Treaty_of_Tordesillas "wikilink") in return for replacement of all
non-Catholic lords, including Toranaga, with those loyal to Portugal and
Rome. He also reveals that Catholic [ronin](Rōnin "wikilink") recently
invaded Japan from a secret Jesuit base in [Macau](Macau "wikilink").

Taken aback, Toranaga halts the departure of Portugal’s trading ship.
This upsets the other Regents, who besides once again failing to
assassinate Blackthorne, cause Toranaga’s abrupt resignation from the
Council so they can not force him to commit
[seppuku](seppuku "wikilink") He quickly flees Osaka as fellow traveler
Blackthorne performs critical and helpful antics; escaping with Mariko
and others for a safer Anjiro.

In Anjiro Blackthorne's Japanese improves as does his grasp of Japanese
customs, but he is still disparaged as a leader of uncouth European
rabble. Regardless, he advances socially, in part, because he shows how
to fire cannons with greater accuracy, and partly due to his
post-earthquake rescue of Toranaga from underneath rubble. Consequently
he is elevated to the high samurai rank of
*[hatamoto](hatamoto "wikilink").* In turn Blackthorne’s regard for
Toranaga rises as it does for a key part of his inner circle, Mariko,
with whom he has a secret affair. A chance encounter has Blackthorne’s
old crew revolted by his Japanese ways, and him by the European
character of their coarseness.

Also in Anjiro, Toranaga feigns, except to Mariko, acquiescence towards
Ishido and no desire to battle. This enables Mariko to re-enter Osaka to
lay bare Ishido’s holding of noble households hostage by trying shortly
thereafter to exit Osaka. Ishido's men respond with violence until an
intentionally unharmed Mariko gives up on leaving. Saying she has been
dishonored, Mariko vows to kill herself the next day. She does almost
end her life, but in a delaying gambit Ishido grants her leave at the
last minute. That night Toranaga’s duplicitous
[vassal](vassal "wikilink") Yabu lets Ishido's
[ninjas](ninja "wikilink") into Toranaga's compound to kidnap Mariko.
While locked in a storeroom Mariko willfully stands in front of a door
set to explode and is killed. Her death, which Ishido sought to prevent,
forces him to free his hostages; thus weakening his military alliances.
As for Yabu, he confesses to Toranaga and complies with his lord’s order
to commit *seppuku*, giving his prized *[katana](katana "wikilink")*
(sword) to Blackthorne.

At the book's end, Toranaga in a soliloquy justifies burning the
*Erasmus* to ally with the Catholic lords who in turn agree not to kill
Blackthorne, whose [karma](karma "wikilink"), Toranaga says, is to never
leave Japan, as Mariko's was to die for her lord, and as his was to be
Japan's restored and absolutely powerful shogun.

Mariko's will gives Blackthorne enough money to build a new ship, for
which Toranaga provides needed craftsmen.

In the epilogue, Toranaga captures Ishido at the [Battle of
Sekigahara](Battle_of_Sekigahara "wikilink") and buries him up to his
neck to die three days later.

## Characters

*Shogun* is a work of historical fiction based upon the power struggle
between the successors of [Toyotomi
Hideyoshi](Toyotomi_Hideyoshi "wikilink") that led to the founding of
the [Tokugawa shogunate](Tokugawa_shogunate "wikilink"). Clavell based
each character on a historical figure, but changed their names in order
to add narrative deniability to the story.

## Historical accuracy

Blackthorne's interactions with Toranaga are closely based upon accounts
in the diaries of Adams. However, while Adams served in Tokugawa's
army at Sekigahara, he did not become a retainer or a samurai until
after the battle.

Adams never met Hosokawa Gracia, in contrast to Blackthorne's intimate
relationship with Toda Mariko.

The novel contains numerous [Japanese
language](Japanese_language "wikilink") errors, as well as mistakenly
depicting [Japanese castles](Japanese_castle "wikilink") as having
[portcullises](portcullis "wikilink") and 17th-century samurai as using
[socket bayonets](Bayonet "wikilink"). [Carrier
pigeons](Homing_pigeon "wikilink"), used extensively by Toranaga, were
unknown in Japan at the time.

## Background

Clavell was an officer in the [Royal
Artillery](Royal_Artillery "wikilink") during [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink") and was a prisoner of war at [Changi
Prison](Changi_Prison "wikilink") in [Singapore](Singapore "wikilink")
from 1942 to 1945, an experience that formed the basis of his first
novel *[King Rat](King_Rat_(Clavell_novel) "wikilink")*. Despite this
experience, he admired Japan and the Japanese people, and described
*Shogun* as "passionately pro-Japanese."

Clavell stated that reading a sentence in his daughter's textbook that
stated that "in 1600, an Englishman went to Japan and became a samurai"
inspired the novel. *Shogun* was therefore based on an actual series
of events involving Adams, who reached Japan in 1600 and became involved
with the future shogun Tokugawa. He achieved high status managing
commercial activities for Tokugawa's shogunate, though much of the
interaction between the various characters in the novel was invented.
The first draft was 2,300 pages and Clavell cut it down to 1,700 with
the help of his editor, German Gollob. However, *Shogun* was edited
lightly in comparison to Clavell's earlier novels.

## Themes

The main theme of the novel is the precarious peace of Japan in 1600, a
nation consumed by endless civil war and political machinations. The
heir to the Taiko (retired Kampaku), the deceased supreme leader of
Japan, is too young to rule, and five *daimyōs* chosen by the late Taiko
for their ability to work together hold power as a Council of Regents
until the boy comes of age. The novel details the intense power struggle
between the two most powerful *daimyōs,* Toranaga and Ishido, as they
both seek to thwart the other's ambitions. As a subtext, there is also
the political manoeuvring of the Protestant and Catholic powers in the
Far East. This translates an internal conflict in Japan between
Christian *daimyōs* (who are motivated in part by a desire to preserve
and expand their religion) and the *daimyōs* who oppose the Japanese
Christians as followers of foreign beliefs and potential traitors whose
loyalty is questionable.

Portugal, which holds the sole right to trade with Japan, and the
Catholic Church, mainly through the Order of the
[Jesuits](Jesuit "wikilink"), have gained a religious, economic, and
political foothold and seek to extend their power in Japan (as they have
done in nearby places such as [Goa](Goa "wikilink") and
[Macao](Macao "wikilink")). Guns and other modern military capabilities
brought to Japan by the Portuguese, and indirectly by Blackthorne, are
still a novelty and coveted by powerful lords looking to gain an
advantage over their rivals, but are despised by many
[samurai](samurai "wikilink") as a threat to their traditional methods
of fighting. In contrast, however, the silk trade is viewed as
essential, and the Portuguese traders regularly amass huge profits via
their annual "Black Ship" fleets from Macao.

Japanese society is shown to be very insular and xenophobic, with
foreigners referred to as "barbarians" and shunned for their arrogance,
eating habits, lack of fluency in the Japanese language, and inability
to respect Japanese social customs. As a result, there are many internal
conflicts between the "Eastern" and "Western" cultures – especially to
do with duty, honor, sexuality, cleanliness, diet, obligations,
hierarchies, loyalties, and – more particularly – the essence of 'self'.
Blackthorne is also torn between his growing affection for Mariko (who
is married to a powerful, abusive, and dangerous samurai, Buntaro), his
increasing loyalty to Toranaga, his household and consort, a "[Willow
world](Geisha "wikilink")" courtesan named Kiku, and his desire to
return to the open seas aboard *Erasmus* so he can intercept the Black
Ship before it reaches Japan.

A recurring motif in the book is Toranaga engaging in
[falconry](falconry "wikilink"). He compares his various birds to his
vassals and mulls over his handling of them, flinging them at targets,
giving them morsels, and bringing them back to his fist for re-hooding.
There are other recurring themes of Eastern values, as opposed to
Western values, masculine (patriarchal) values as opposed to human
values, etc. Another is the granting of honours and favours to those who
display loyalty - including the trading of secrets by a
*[mama-san](mama-san "wikilink")* called Gyoko, which allows Toranaga to
gain an upperhand in his power play for the shogunate.

## Reception

*[The New York Times](The_New_York_Times "wikilink")*{{'}}s Webster
Schott wrote, "I can't remember when a novel has seized my mind like
this one \[...\] It's almost impossible not to continue to read *Shōgun*
once having opened it". In addition to becoming a best-seller, with
more than six million copies of the novel in 14 hardcover and 38
paperback printings by 1980, *Shōgun* had great impact on westerners'
knowledge of, and interest in, Japanese history and culture. Henry
Smith, editor of *Learning from Shōgun: Japanese History and Western
Fantasy* (1980), estimated that 20 to 50% of all students in American
college-level courses about Japan had read the novel. He described the
book as "a virtual encyclopedia of Japanese history and culture;
somewhere among those half-million words, one can find a brief
description of virtually everything one wanted to know about Japan", and
stated that "In sheer quantity, *Shōgun* has probably conveyed more
information about Japan to more people than all the combined writings of
scholars, journalists, and novelists since the [Pacific
War](Pacific_War "wikilink")". Criticizing inaccuracies in the
author's depiction of Japan, Smith wrote in *[History
Today](History_Today "wikilink")* that "Clavell is in effect delivering
a sermon on the errant ways of the West", contrasting Blackthorn and
other Christian Westerners' barbaric ways to the superior "meditative
and fatalistic posture of the Japanese samurai". The author of
*James Clavell: A Critical Companion* called the novel "one of the most
effective depictions of cross-cultural encounters ever written", and
"Clavell's finest effort".

Clavell said that *Shōgun* "is [B.C.](Before_Christ "wikilink") and
[A.D.](Anno_Domini "wikilink") It made me. I became a brand name, like
[Heinz Baked Beans](Heinz_Baked_Beans "wikilink")." He reported that
the ruler of a Middle Eastern [petrostate](petrostate "wikilink")
offered him a full [oil tanker](oil_tanker "wikilink") for a novel that
would do for his country what *Shōgun* did for Japan.

## Adaptations

### Television

In 1976 Clavell employed [Robert Bolt](Robert_Bolt "wikilink") to write
a screenplay. Later, in 1978, he selected [Eric
Bercovici](Eric_Bercovici "wikilink") to write a
[miniseries](miniseries "wikilink") for NBC. Clavell and Bercovici
decided to simplify the story for an American television audience by
omitting one of the two major plot lines of the novel, the struggle
between Toranaga and the other warlords, and focusing on the adventures
of Blackthorne and his romance with Mariko. Due to the focus on
Blackthorne's perspective, most of the Japanese dialogue was not
subtitled or dubbed. This nine-hour [television
miniseries](Shōgun_(1980_miniseries) "wikilink") aired in 1980, starring
[Richard Chamberlain](Richard_Chamberlain "wikilink"), [Toshiro
Mifune](Toshiro_Mifune "wikilink"), [Yoko
Shimada](Yoko_Shimada "wikilink"), and [John
Rhys-Davies](John_Rhys-Davies "wikilink"). This was edited into a
two-hour theatrical release. A 5-disc DVD release appeared in 2003 and a
3-disc Blu-ray release in 2014.

On August 3, 2018, it was announced that
[FX](FX_(TV_channel) "wikilink") would be adapting the [novel into a
miniseries](Shōgun_(2024_miniseries) "wikilink"). The 2024
miniseries stars [Hiroyuki Sanada](Hiroyuki_Sanada "wikilink"), who also
served as co-producer, [Cosmo Jarvis](Cosmo_Jarvis "wikilink"), [Anna
Sawai](Anna_Sawai "wikilink"), [Tadanobu
Asano](Tadanobu_Asano "wikilink"), [Takehiro
Hira](Takehiro_Hira "wikilink"), [Tommy Bastow](Tommy_Bastow "wikilink")
and [Fumi Nikaido](Fumi_Nikaido "wikilink"). The trailer was
released in late 2023 and the first two episodes premiered on February
27, 2024. In contrast to the 1980 miniseries, this closely follows
both plot lines of the novel and translates the dialogue between the
Japanese characters, although several characters' names are changed, for
instance, Yabu was changed to Yabushige.

### Stage musical

A [stage musical adaptation](Shōgun:_The_Musical "wikilink") was
produced in 1990.

### Games

There have been three computer games based on the Shōgun novel. Two
[text-based adventure](text_adventure "wikilink") games with sparse
graphics were produced for the [Amiga](Amiga "wikilink") and PC,
marketed as *[James Clavell's
Shōgun](James_Clavell's_Shōgun "wikilink")* by
[Infocom](Infocom "wikilink") and *Shōgun* by
[Mastertronic](Mastertronic "wikilink"). A unique graphical adventure
game, *Shōgun*, was also produced for systems including the [Commodore
64](Commodore_64 "wikilink"), [Amstrad CPC](Amstrad_CPC "wikilink") and
[IBM PC](IBM_PC "wikilink") by Lee & Mathias and released by [Virgin
Entertainment](Virgin_Entertainment "wikilink") in 1986.

The tabletop game publisher [FASA](FASA "wikilink") published *James
Clavell's Shogun* in 1983. This was the third of four boardgame titles
based on Clavell novels.
