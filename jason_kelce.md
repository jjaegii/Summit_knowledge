## College career

A former walk-on [running back](running_back "wikilink"), Kelce switched
to [fullback](Fullback_(gridiron_football) "wikilink") and then finally
to offensive line after
[redshirting](Redshirt_(college_sports) "wikilink") his initial year at
the [University of Cincinnati](University_of_Cincinnati "wikilink")
(UC),[8] seeing action at center and
[guard](Guard_(gridiron_football) "wikilink") in nine games in 2007 as
the Bearcats went 10–3 and defeated [Southern
Mississippi](Southern_Miss_Golden_Eagles_football "wikilink") 31–21 in
the [PapaJohns.com Bowl](2007_PapaJohns.com_Bowl "wikilink").[9][10]

As a sophomore in 2008, he made 13 starts at left guard, as part of an
offensive line that also included future NFL linemen [Jeff
Linkenbach](Jeff_Linkenbach "wikilink") and [Trevor
Canfield](Trevor_Canfield "wikilink"), which helped the UC offense
average 27.3 points and 375.3 yards of total offense per game. The
Bearcats went 11–3 overall, were [Big East
Conference](Big_East_Conference_(1979–2013) "wikilink") champions, and
played in the [FedEx Orange Bowl](2009_Orange_Bowl "wikilink"), where
the Bearcats fell to [Virginia
Tech](Virginia_Tech_Hokies_football "wikilink") 20–7.[11][12] In 2008,
his brother, Travis, began playing alongside him at Cincinnati.[13]

In 2009, Kelce earned second-team All-Big East honors after starting 13
games at left guard as the Bearcats went undefeated in the regular
season (12–0) and were again Big East Champions, once again earning a
[BCS](Bowl_Championship_Series "wikilink") Bowl berth, losing to
[Florida](Florida_Gators_football "wikilink") 51–24 in the [Allstate
Sugar Bowl](2010_Sugar_Bowl "wikilink").[14][15]

He was moved to center for his senior season in 2010 as the Bearcats
went 4–8 under new coach [Butch Jones](Butch_Jones "wikilink").[16][17]
He started the final 38 games of his 47-game Bearcats career, 26 at left
guard and 12 at center.[18] He was named Honorable Mention
[All-America](All-America "wikilink") and second-team All-Big East.

## Professional career

Despite lacking true NFL size, Kelce was projected a fourth round
pick.[19] He ran the fastest [40-yard dash](40-yard_dash "wikilink")
time of all offensive linemen at the 2011 [NFL Scouting
Combine](NFL_Scouting_Combine "wikilink"), with a 4.89-second time.[20]

was unable to practice or sign a contract until the [NFL
lockout](2011_NFL_lockout "wikilink") was lifted on July 25, 2011. He
signed a four-year contract on July 27.[23] New offensive line coach
[Howard Mudd](Howard_Mudd "wikilink") envisioned Kelce as in the mold of
[Indianapolis Colts](Indianapolis_Colts "wikilink") five-time [Pro
Bowl](Pro_Bowl "wikilink") center [Jeff
Saturday](Jeff_Saturday "wikilink"), whom Mudd coached in Indianapolis
for 11 seasons.[24] First-round pick and fellow rookie [Danny
Watkins](Danny_Watkins "wikilink") compared Kelce to a hedgehog due to
his spiky hair and facial hair, in addition to his quickness and
stoutness.[25] Kelce battled incumbent starter [Jamaal
Jackson](Jamaal_Jackson "wikilink") for the center job early in training
camp in August.[26] Kelce received all of the first-team reps in the
week before the team's third preseason game.[27] He started in the third
preseason game against the [Cleveland
Browns](Cleveland_Browns "wikilink"), and allowed a sack and was
penalized for holding.[28] Kelce was named the starter for the season on
August 29.[29] He became the first rookie in Eagles history to start all
16 games at center.[30]

with the Eagles, defeating the [New England
Patriots](New_England_Patriots "wikilink") 41–33.[41]

During the Eagles' Super Bowl parade on February 8, 2018, Kelce garnered
national attention after giving an impassioned speech where he defended
his teammates, coaches, and front office and compared Eagles fans to
hungry dogs who "for 52 years have been starved of this
championship,"[42] while dressed as a
[mummer](Mummers_Parade "wikilink"). 

In 2018, Kelce was given his second First-team All-Pro honor.

On March 2, 2019, Kelce signed a one-year contract extension with the
Eagles through the 2021 season.[43] During the 2019 season, Kelce was

All-Pro Honor.

In 2020, Kelce started his 100th straight game with the Eagles. The
offensive line saw a franchise-record 14 different starting
combinations, but Kelce was the lone man to start every game. He was

[Art Rooney Award](Art_Rooney_Award "wikilink") in 2020.[44]

On March 5, 2021, Kelce signed a new deal with the Philadelphia
Eagles.[45][46] He was placed on the COVID list on January 3, 2022, and
activated four days later, allowing him to keep his consecutive starts
streak alive.[47][48] He went in for the team's first offensive snap
then was benched for the rest of the game. In 2021, Kelce was selected
to his fifth Pro Bowl, marking his third straight selection, and was the
Eagles finalist for the [Walter Payton Man of the Year
Award](Walter_Payton_Man_of_the_Year_Award "wikilink").[49] He was also
named a first-team All-Pro by the [Associated
Press](Associated_Press "wikilink") for the fourth time in his
career.[50] He was ranked 71st by his fellow players on the [NFL Top 100
Players of 2022](NFL_Top_100_Players_of_2022 "wikilink").[51]

On March 11, 2022, after mulling retirement before the 2022 offseason,
Kelce signed a new one-year deal with the Eagles worth $14 million,
which made him the highest paid center in the NFL.[52] Kelce earned Pro
Bowl and first team All-Pro honors for the 2022 season.[53][54]

Kelce and the Eagles appeared in [Super Bowl
LVII](Super_Bowl_LVII "wikilink") against the [Kansas City
Chiefs](Kansas_City_Chiefs "wikilink"). Kelce's brother, Travis, played
for the Chiefs, making it the first Super Bowl to feature two brothers
on opposing teams as players.[55] The Eagles would lose the game
38–35.[56]
