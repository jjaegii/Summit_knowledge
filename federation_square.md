# Federation Square

**Federation Square** (marketed and colloquially known as **Fed
Square**) is a venue for arts, culture and public events on the edge
of the [Melbourne](Melbourne "wikilink") [central business
district](central_business_district "wikilink"). It covers an area of at
the intersection of [Flinders](Flinders_Street,_Melbourne "wikilink")
and [Swanston Streets](Swanston_Street "wikilink") built above busy
railway lines and across the road from [Flinders Street
station](Flinders_Street_railway_station "wikilink"). It incorporates
major cultural institutions such as the [Ian Potter
Centre](Ian_Potter_Centre "wikilink"), [Australian Centre for the Moving
Image](Australian_Centre_for_the_Moving_Image "wikilink") (ACMI) and the
[Koorie Heritage Trust](Koorie_Heritage_Trust "wikilink") as well as
cafes and bars in a series of buildings centred around a large paved
square, and a glass walled atrium.

## History

### Background

Melbourne's central city grid was originally designed without a central
public square, long seen as a missing element. From the 1920s there were
proposals to roof the railway yards on the southeast corner of
[Flinders](Flinders_Street,_Melbourne "wikilink") and [Swanston
Streets](Swanston_Street "wikilink") for a public square, with more
detailed proposals prepared in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1960s, the
[Melbourne City Council](Melbourne_City_Council "wikilink") decided that
the best place for the [City Square](City_Square,_Melbourne "wikilink")
was the corner of Swanston and [Collins
Streets](Collins_Street,_Melbourne "wikilink"), opposite the town hall.
The first temporary square opened in 1968, and a permanent version
opened in 1981. It was however not considered a great success, and was
redeveloped in the 1990s as a smaller, simpler space in front of a new
large hotel.

Meanwhile, in the late 1960s, a small part of the railway lines had been
partly roofed by the construction of the [Princes Gate
Towers](Princes_Gate_Towers "wikilink"), known as the Gas & Fuel
Buildings after their major tenant, the [Gas and Fuel
Corporation](Gas_and_Fuel_Corporation "wikilink"), over the old [Princes
Bridge station](Princes_Bridge_railway_station "wikilink"). This
included a plaza on the corner, which was elevated above the street and
little used. Between the plaza and Batman Avenue, which ran along the
north bank of the [Yarra River](Yarra_River "wikilink"), were the
extensive [Jolimont Railway Yards](Jolimont_Yard "wikilink"), and the
through train lines running into Flinders Street station under Swanston
Street.

In 1978 the idea of roofing the railyards was again proposed as part of
a State Government competition for a landmark, asking for “an idea, a
word, image or plan” to put Melbourne on the map. It drew 2300 entries,
but only the more bizarre ideas were published, creating "a glorious
farce.”, and no winner was declared.

### Design competition and controversy

In 1996 the [Premier](Premier_of_Victoria "wikilink") [Jeff
Kennett](Jeff_Kennett "wikilink") announced that the Gas & Fuel
Buildings would be demolished, and the railyards roofed, and a complex
including arts facilities and a large public space would be built. It
was to be named Federation Square, and opened in time to celebrate the
centenary of Australia's Federation in 2001, and would include
performing arts facilities, a gallery, a cinemedia centre, the public
space, a glazed wintergarden, and ancillary cafe and retail spaces. An
[architectural design
competition](architectural_design_competition "wikilink") was announced
that received 177 entries from around the world. Five designs were
shortlisted, which included entries from high-profile Melbourne
architects [Denton Corker Marshall](Denton_Corker_Marshall "wikilink")
and [Ashton Raggatt McDougall](Ashton_Raggatt_McDougall "wikilink"), and
lesser known Sydney architect Chris Elliott, and London based
architects Jenny Lowe and Adrian Hawker. The jury was chaired by
Professor [Neville Quarry](Neville_Quarry "wikilink"). The winner
announced on 28 July 1997, a consortium led by **[Lab Architecture
Studio](Lab_Architecture_Studio "wikilink")** directed by Donald Bates
and Peter Davidson from [London](London "wikilink"), with the Dutch
landscape architects **Karres en Brands**, directed by Sylvia Karres
and Bart Brands, teamed with local executive architects **[Bates
Smart](Bates_Smart "wikilink")**for the second stage.

The design, originally costed at between $110 and $128 million, was
complex and irregular, with gently angled 'cranked' geometries
predominating in both the planning and the facade treatment of the
various buildings and the wintergardens that surrounded and defined the
open spaces. A series of 'shards' provided vertical accents, while
interconnected laneways and stairways and the wintergarden would connect
Flinders Street to the Yarra River. The open square was arranged as a
gently sloping amphitheatre, focussed on a large viewing screen for
public events, with a secondary sloped plaza area on the main corner.
The design was widely supported by the design community but was less
popular with the public. The design was also soon criticised when it was
realised that the western freestanding 'shard' would block views of the
south front of [St Paul's
Cathedral](St_Paul's_Cathedral,_Melbourne "wikilink") from [Princes
Bridge](Princes_Bridge "wikilink").

The mix of occupants and tenants were soon modified, with the cinemedia
centre becoming the new body known as
[ACMI](Australian_Centre_for_the_Moving_Image "wikilink"), offices for
multicultural broadcaster [SBS](Special_Broadcasting_Service "wikilink")
added, and the gallery space becoming the Australian art wing of the
[National Gallery of Victoria](National_Gallery_of_Victoria "wikilink"),
which became the Ian Potter Centre. The performance arts space was
dropped, the number of commercial tenancies increased, and the south end
of the Atrium became an auditorium. A new substantially rearranged
design incorporating the new program was revealed in late 1998.

### Construction

After the 1999 State election, while construction was well underway, the
incoming [Bracks Government](Bracks_Ministry "wikilink") ordered a
report by the [University of
Melbourne](University_of_Melbourne "wikilink")'s Professor Evan Walker
into the 'western shard' to be located on the corner of Flinders and
Swanston Streets, which concluded in February 2000 that the "heritage
vista" towards St Paul's cathedral should be preserved, and the shard be
no more than 8m in height.

Budgets on the project blew out significantly due to the initial cost
being seriously underestimated, given the expense of covering the
railyards, changes to the brief, the need to resolve construction
methods for the angular design, and the long delays. Among
measures taken to cut costs was concreting areas originally designed for
paving.

The final cost of construction was approximately $467 million (over four
times the original estimate), the main funding primarily from the state
government, with $64 million from the City of Melbourne, some from the
[federal government](Government_of_Australia "wikilink"), while private
operators and sponsors paid for fitouts or naming rights.

The square was opened on 26 October 2002. Unlike many Australian
landmarks, it was not opened by the reigning monarch, [Elizabeth
II](Elizabeth_II "wikilink"), nor was she invited to its unveiling; she
visited Federation Square in October 2011.

### Further expansion

In 2006, Federation Wharf redeveloped the vaults under Princes Walk (a
former roadway) into a large bar, with extensive outdoor areas on the
Yarra riverbank, with elevator access to Federation Square.

Several proposals have been prepared for the area known as Federation
Square East, the remaining area of railyards to the east. There have
been proposals for office towers and, more recently, a combination of
open space and a hotel, or another campus for the National Gallery of
Victoria to house their contemporary art collection.

### Apple Store

In December 2017, the [Andrews](Daniel_Andrews "wikilink") government
announced that one of the buildings of the square, the Yarra Building,
would be demolished to make way for a freestanding [Apple
Store](Apple_Store "wikilink"), generating strong criticism over the
commercial use of a cultural space. Opposition groups including [Our
City Our Square](https://www.ourcityoursquare.org/) and the [National
Trust of Australia
(Victoria)](National_Trust_of_Australia_(Victoria) "wikilink") then
nominated Fed Square to the [Victorian Heritage
Register](Victorian_Heritage_Register "wikilink"), which resulted in an
interim decision to list in October 2018. Apple cancelled the plans
in April 2019 after the application to Heritage Victoria to demolish the
Yarra Building was denied, and after a hearing, the square was
formally listed in August 2019.

### Metro Entrance

With the construction of the upcoming [Melbourne Metro
Tunnel](Melbourne_metro "wikilink"), an entrance to the underground Town
Hall station from the corner of Federation Square was proposed, with a
design released in December 2018 that would replace the corner
Information Centre. After the heritage listing of the square, a
permit was sought to demolish the building and the plaza around it,
which was granted on the basis that the Information Centre was not the
original design for the 'Western Shard', and it was demolished by
January 2019, though without a final approved design for the new
entrance.

### Later Developments

In early 2022, following the decision to build a new National Gallery
Victoria Contemporary behind the NGV, with a linear public space
connection through to St Kilda Road, the State Government established
the [Melbourne Arts Precinct
Corporation](Melbourne_Arts_Precinct_Corporation "wikilink") to manage
the delivery of the new park, the management of Federation Square, and
to better connect the various arts institutions in Southbank to each
other and through to the CBD.

In October 2023 the Age newspaper ran a series of articles on the
square, providing a range of opinions on its strengths and weaknesses.
The failure of many cafes and shops over the years was noted, as well as
the rough surface affecting mobility, the lack of shade, and the lack of
clear paths through the site, concluding that the square was still a
'work in progress'.

## Location and layout

Federation Square occupies roughly a whole [urban
block](urban_block "wikilink") bounded by
[Swanston](Swanston_Street "wikilink"),
[Flinders](Flinders_Street,_Melbourne "wikilink"), and [Russell
Streets](Russell_Street,_Melbourne "wikilink") and the [Yarra
River](Yarra_River "wikilink"). The open public square is directly
opposite [Flinders Street
station](Flinders_Street_railway_station "wikilink") and [St Paul's
Cathedral](St_Paul's_Cathedral,_Melbourne "wikilink"). The layout of the
precinct is designed to connect the historical central district of the
city with the Yarra River and a new park [Birrarung
Marr](Birrarung_Marr "wikilink").


## Design features

### Square

The complex of buildings forms a rough U-shape around the main open-air
square, oriented to the west. The eastern end of the square is formed by
the glazed walls of The Atrium. While [bluestone](bluestone "wikilink")
is used for the majority of the paving in the Atrium and St Paul's
Court, matching footpaths elsewhere in central Melbourne, the main
square is paved in 470,000 [ochre](ochre "wikilink")-coloured sandstone
blocks from [Western Australia](Western_Australia "wikilink") and
invokes images of the [outback](outback "wikilink"). The paving is
designed as a huge urban artwork, called *Nearamnew*, by [Paul
Carter](Paul_Carter_(academic) "wikilink") and gently rises above street
level, containing a number of textual pieces inlaid in its undulating
surface.

There are a small number of [landscaped](Landscaping "wikilink")
sections in the square and plaza which are planted with
[Eucalyptus](Eucalyptus "wikilink") trees.

### Plaza and giant screen

A key part of the plaza design is its large and fixed public television
screen, which has been used to broadcast major sporting events such as
the [AFL Grand Final](AFL_Grand_Final "wikilink") and the [Australian
Open](Australian_Open "wikilink") every year. It is currently the
biggest broadcasting screen in Australia.

### Buildings

The architecture of the square is in the
[deconstructivist](deconstructivist "wikilink") style, with both plan
and elevations designed around slightly angular, 'cranked' geometries,
rather than tradition orthogonal grids. The built forms are mainly
slightly bent north–south volumes, separated by glazed gaps, a reference
to traditional Melbourne laneways, with vertical 'shards', attached or
freestanding, containing discrete functions like the Visitor's Centre,
or lifts and stairs.

The larger built volumes are relatively simple reinforced concrete
buildings with glass walls, but with a second outer skin of cladding
carried on heavy steel framing, folded and stepped slightly to create
angular undulating surfaces. The cladding is composed of 6 different
materials, zinc, perforated zinc, glass, frosted glass, sandstone and no
cladding, in a camouflage-like pattern, and created using [pinwheel
tiling](pinwheel_tiling "wikilink"). The 'crossbar' is an east–west
built from that runs through the long gallery building, and is clad in
perforated black steel panels.

Some buildings are named. The building along Flinders Street that houses
ACMI and SBS is named the Alfred Deakin Building, the building between
the plaza space and the river is called the Yarra Building, while the
building that houses the NGV Australia is also called the [Ian Potter
Centre](Ian_Potter_Centre:_NGV_Australia "wikilink").

### Shards

Three shards frame the square space. The eastern and southern shards are
completely clad in metallic surfaces with angular slots, very similar in
design to the [Jewish Museum Berlin](Jewish_Museum_Berlin "wikilink"),
while the western shard is clad in glass. Adjoined to the southern shard
is a hotel which features the wrap around metallic screen and glass
[louvers](louver "wikilink").

### Laneways

There are a number of unnamed laneways in the Federation Square complex
which connect it to both Flinders Street and the Yarra River via
stairways. The stairways between the Western Shard and nearby buildings
are also paved in larger flat rectangle sandstone blocks.

### Riverfront

The riverfront areas extend south to an elevated pedestrian promenade
which was once part of Batman Avenue and is lined with tall established
trees of both deciduous exotic species and Australian eucalpyts. More
recently, the vaults adjacent to the Princes Bridge have been converted
into Federation Wharf, a series of cafes and boat berths. Some of the
areas between the stairs and lanes leading to the river are landscaped
with shady tree ferns.

### Atrium

The "[atrium](Atrium_(architecture) "wikilink")" is one of the major
public spaces in the precinct. It is a
[laneway](laneway "wikilink")-like space, five stories high with glazed
walls and roof. The exposed metal structure and glazing patterns follow
the [pinwheel tiling](pinwheel_tiling "wikilink") pattern used elsewhere
in the precinct's building [facades](facades "wikilink").

### Labyrinth

The "labyrinth" is a [passive cooling](passive_cooling "wikilink")
system sandwiched above the railway lines and below the middle of the
square. The [concrete](concrete "wikilink") structure consists of 1.2 km
of interlocking, honeycombed walls. It covers 1600 m<sup>2</sup>. The
walls have a corrugated profile to maximize their [surface
area](Area "wikilink"), and are spaced 60 cm apart.

During [summer](summer "wikilink") nights, cold air is pumped in the
combed space, cooling down the concrete, while heat absorbed during the
day is pumped out. The following day, cold air is pumped from the
labyrinth out into the atrium through floor vents. This process can keep
the atrium up to 12 °C cooler than outside. This is comparable to
conventional [air conditioning](air_conditioning "wikilink"), but using
one-tenth the energy and producing one-tenth the [carbon
dioxide](carbon_dioxide "wikilink").

During [winter](winter "wikilink"), the process is reversed, storing
warm daytime air in the Labyrinth overnight, and pumping it back into
the atrium during the day.

The system can also partly cool the
[ACMI](Australian_Centre_for_the_Moving_Image "wikilink") building when
the power is not required by the atrium.

### Flagpoles

In the Federation Square complex, there are a number of flagpoles, most
notably a group of four, three of which permanently fly the Australian,
Aboriginal, and Torres Strait Islander flags. The fourth flagpole
occasionally flies the flag of a foreign country to celebrate a national
holiday of that country, for example an independence day. Prior to 2022
foreign countries' flags were usually flown on a group of eight
flagpoles located next to a bus stop.

## Facilities and tenants

In addition to a number of shops,
[bars](bar_(establishment) "wikilink"), [cafés](café "wikilink") and
[restaurants](restaurant "wikilink"), Federation Square's cultural
facilities include:

### Melbourne Visitor Centre

The Melbourne Visitor Centre is located underground, with its entrance
at the main corner shard directly opposite Flinders Street Station and
St Pauls Cathedral and its exit at the opposite shard. The entrance and
exit shards feature interactive news tickers in colour LEDs and small
screens promoting current activities. The Visitor Centre was intended to
replace a facility which was previously located at the turn of the
19th-century town hall administration buildings on Swanston Street. The
Visitors Centre was demolished in December 2018 to make way for an
entrance to the [rapid transit](Metro_Tunnel "wikilink") station to be
built under the Swanston Street, and the visitors centre returned to the
Town Hall.

### The Edge

The Edge theatre is a 450-seat space designed to have views of the Yarra
River and across to the spire of [The Arts
Centre](Arts_Centre_Melbourne "wikilink"). The theatre is lined in wood
veneer in similar geometrical patterns to other interiors in the
complex. The Edge was named "The [BMW](BMW "wikilink") Edge" until May
2013, when a new [sponsorship deal](sponsorship_deal "wikilink") with
[Deakin University](Deakin_University "wikilink") caused it to be
renamed "The Deakin Edge".

### Zinc

Zinc is a function space underneath the gallery building, and opens onto
the Yarra river bank. It was intended as an entirely commercial part of
the development of Federation Square, and is used for wedding
receptions, corporate events, launches, and the like.

### National Gallery of Victoria
The [Ian
Potter Centre](Ian_Potter_Centre "wikilink"), also known as the NGVA,
houses the Australian part of the art collection of the [National
Gallery of Victoria](National_Gallery_of_Victoria "wikilink") (NGV), in
the building along the eastern side. (The St Kilda Rd building now
houses that International works of the NGV, and is known as the NGVI).
There are over 20,000 Australian artworks, including paintings,
sculpture, photography, fashion and textiles, and the collection is the
oldest and most well known in the country.

Well-known works at the Ian Potter Centre include [Frederick
McCubbin](Frederick_McCubbin "wikilink")'s *Pioneers* (1904) and [Tom
Roberts](Tom_Roberts "wikilink")' *[Shearing the
Rams](Shearing_the_Rams "wikilink")* (1890). Also featured are works
from [Sidney Nolan](Sidney_Nolan "wikilink"), [John
Perceval](John_Perceval "wikilink"), [Margaret
Preston](Margaret_Preston "wikilink") and [Fred
Williams](Fred_Williams_(artist) "wikilink"). Indigenous art includes
works by [William Barak](William_Barak "wikilink") and [Emily
Kngwarreye](Emily_Kngwarreye "wikilink").

The National Gallery at Federation Square also features the NGV Kids
Corner, which is an interactive education section aimed at small
children and families, and the NGV Studio.

### ACMI (Australian Centre for the Moving Image)

The [Australian Centre for the Moving
Image](Australian_Centre_for_the_Moving_Image "wikilink") known as ACMI
has two cinemas that are equipped to play every film, video and digital
video format, with attention to high-quality acoustics. The screen
gallery, built along the entire length of what was previously a train
station platform, is a subterranean gallery for experimentation with the
moving image. Video art, installations, interactives, sound art and net
art are all regularly exhibited in this space. Additional venues within
ACMI allow computer-based public education, and other interactive
presentations.

In 2003, ACMI commissioned SelectParks to produce an interactive
game-based, [site-specific
installation](site-specific_installation "wikilink") called AcmiPark,
which replicated and abstracted the real-world architecture of
Federation Square. It also houses highly innovative mechanisms for
interactive, multi-player sound and musical composition.

### Transport Hotel Bar

Transport hotel and bar is a three-level hotel complex adjacent to the
southern shard on the south western corner of the square. It has a
ground-floor public bar, restaurant and cocktail lounge on the rooftop.

### SBS Radio and Television offices

The Melbourne offices of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), one of
Australia's two publicly funded national broadcasters, is in the Deakin
Building on Flinders Street.

### Melbourne Festival headquarters

The headquarters of Melbourne Festival (formerly Melbourne International
Arts Festival) are located on Level 2 of the Yarra Building.

### Beer awards

Federation Square has recently become home to several beer award shows,
and tastings, including the [Australian International Beer
Awards](Australian_International_Beer_Awards "wikilink") trade and
public shows, as well as other similar events such as showcases of local
and other Australian breweries. These events have been held in the
square's outdoor area the Atrium and usually require an entry fee in
exchange for a set number of tastings.

### Past tenants

Past tenants have included:

-   "Champions", The Australian Racing Museum & Hall of Fame — Relocated
    to [Melbourne Cricket Ground](Melbourne_Cricket_Ground "wikilink").
-   National Design Centre — Relocated to [National Gallery of
    Victoria](National_Gallery_of_Victoria "wikilink")

## Reception and recognition

In 2009, [Virtual Tourist](Virtual_Tourist "wikilink") awarded
Federation Square with the title of the 'World's Fifth Ugliest
Building'. Criticisms of it ranged from its damage to the heritage
vista to its similarity to a bombed-out war-time bunker due to its "army
camouflage" colours. A judge from Virtual Tourist justified Federation
Square's ranking on the ugly list claiming that: "Frenzied and overly
complicated, the chaotic feel of the complex is made worse by a web of
unsightly wires from which overhead lights dangle." It continues to
be a 'pet hate' of Melburnians and was discussed on ABC's *Art
Nation*.

After its opening on 26 October 2002, Federation Square remained
controversial among Melburnians due to its unpopular
[architecture](architecture "wikilink"), but also because of its
successive cost blowouts and construction delays (as its name suggests,
it was to have opened in time for the centenary of [Australian
Federation](Australian_Federation "wikilink") on 1 January 2001). The
construction manager was
[Multiplex](Multiplex_(company) "wikilink").

The designers of Federation Square did not get any work for six months
after the completion of the A$450 million public space, but did receive
hate-mail from people who disliked the design.

The *[Australian Financial
Review](Australian_Financial_Review "wikilink")* later reported that
some Melburnians have learned to love the building, citing the record
number of people using and visiting it. In 2005 it was included on
*The Atlantic Cities*' 2011 list of "10 Great Central Plazas and
Squares".

## Architecture and Urban Design Awards

At the Victorian State Architecture Awards held in June 2003, Federation
Square was awarded the prestigious [Victorian Architecture
Medal](Victorian_Architecture_Medal "wikilink"), the [Melbourne
Prize](Melbourne_Prize "wikilink") and the Joseph Reed Award for Urban
Design by the Victorian Chapter of the Royal [Australian Institute of
Architects](Australian_Institute_of_Architects "wikilink").

In November 2003, the project won the [Walter Burley
Griffin](Walter_Burley_Griffin "wikilink") Award for Urban Design and
the Interior Architecture Award for The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia
(Federation Square) at the National Awards of the Royal Australian
Institute of Architects.
