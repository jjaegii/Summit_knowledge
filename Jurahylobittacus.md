# Jurahylobittacus

***Jurahylobittacus**'' is an extinct [genus](genus "wikilink") of
[hangingfly](hangingfly "wikilink") in the family
[Bittacidae](Bittacidae "wikilink") and containing a
[single](monotypic "wikilink") species***Jurahylobittacus
astictus**''.[1] The species is known only from the [Middle
Jurassic](Middle_Jurassic "wikilink") [Jiulongshan
Formation](Jiulongshan_Formation "wikilink"), part of the [Daohugou
Beds](Daohugou_Beds "wikilink"), near the village of Daohugou in
[Ningcheng County](Ningcheng_County "wikilink"), northeastern
[China](China "wikilink").[2]

## History and classification

*Jurahylobittacus astictus* is known only from one fossil, the
[holotype](holotype "wikilink"), specimen numbers "CNU-M-NN2007002-1"
and "CNU-M-NN2007002-2" for the [part and
counterpart](Counter_slab "wikilink") respectively. The specimen is
composed of an almost complete specimen of unidentified sex and is
preserved as a [compression fossil](compression_fossil "wikilink") in a
sedimentary rock. The fossil was recovered from outcrops of the
Jiulongshan Formation exposed in the Wuhua Township by Chung-Kun
Shih.[3] The type specimen is currently preserved in the [Key Lab of
Insect Evolution & Environmental Changes](paleoentomology "wikilink")
collections housed in the [Capital Normal
University](Capital_Normal_University "wikilink"), located in
[Beijing](Beijing "wikilink"), [China](China "wikilink").
*Jurahylobittacus* was first studied by Yan-Li Li, Dong Ren and ChungKun
Shih of the Capital Normal University. Their 2008 [type
description](Type_(biology) "wikilink") of the genus and species was
published online and then in print in the journal
*[Zootaxa](Zootaxa "wikilink")*.[4] The [generic](genus "wikilink") name
was coined by Li, Ren and Shih from a combination of "*Jura*" a
reference to the Jurassic; and the modern Bittacidae genus
*[Hylobittacus](Hylobittacus "wikilink")* to which *Jurahylobittacus* is
related. The [etymology](etymology "wikilink") of the [specific
epithet](species "wikilink") *astictus* is in reference to the lack of
[maculae](wikt:macula "wikilink") present on any of the holotype
specimens' wings.[5]

*Jurahylobittacus astictus* is one of six genera of fossil Bittacidae to
be described from China.[6] Along with *Jurahylobittacus*,
*[Mongolbittacus](Mongolbittacus "wikilink")* and
*[Formosibittacus](Formosibittacus "wikilink")* are known from the
Jiulongshan Formation, while *[Megabittacus](Megabittacus "wikilink")*
and *[Sibirobittacus](Sibirobittacus "wikilink")* are from the [Yixian
Formation](Yixian_Formation "wikilink") and
*[Liaobittacus](Liaobittacus "wikilink")* is from the [Haifanggou
Formation](Haifanggou_Formation "wikilink").[7]

## Description

The holotype specimen is fully complete with only the apical sections of
the legs obscured. The [fore and hind-wings](insect_wing "wikilink") of
*Jurahylobittacus* do not show any signs [color
pattering](Animal_colouration "wikilink") unlike the genus
*Formosibittacus* which it lived alongside. Also unlike
*Formosibittacus* the wings of *J. astictus* do not have any maculae.
The fore-wings are long and the hind-wings are long. The hind and
forewings are generally similar in overall vein structure to the extinct
*Sibirobittacus* and also to the modern *Hylobittacus* but can be
distinguished from both by the finer venation details. Overall the wings
of *Jurahylobittacus* have a narrow base section widening to
approximately along most of the length, while the body was in length.
