# 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike

From July 14 to November 9, 2023, the American actors' union
[SAG-AFTRA](SAG-AFTRA "wikilink") (Screen Actors Guild – American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists) was [on
strike](on_strike "wikilink") over a [labor
dispute](labor_dispute "wikilink") with the [Alliance of Motion Picture
and Television
Producers](Alliance_of_Motion_Picture_and_Television_Producers "wikilink")
(AMPTP). As the longest strike in SAG-AFTRA history, its combined
impact with the [2023 Writers Guild of America
strike](2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike "wikilink") resulted in the
loss of 45,000 jobs, and "an estimated $6.5 billion" loss to the
economy of [Southern California](Southern_California "wikilink").
According to *[Deadline Hollywood](Deadline_Hollywood "wikilink")*, the
"harshest pain" was "perhaps felt among the below-the-line workers
who've had to sell or mortgage their homes, and wipe through IRAs to
survive."

Along with the [2023 Writers Guild of America
strike](2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike "wikilink") (which ended on
September 27, 2023), it was part of a series of [broader Hollywood
labor disputes](2023_Hollywood_labor_disputes "wikilink"). Both the 2023
SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes contributed to the biggest interruption to the
[American film and television
industries](American_film_and_television_industry "wikilink") since [the
impact of the COVID-19
pandemic](Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_television_in_the_United_States "wikilink")
in 2020 just three years prior. In addition to standing in solidarity
with the writers, the strike was led by changes in the industry caused
by [streaming](Streaming_media "wikilink") and its effect on
[residuals](Residual_(entertainment_industry) "wikilink"), as well as
other new technologies like
[AI](Generative_artificial_intelligence "wikilink") and [digital
recreation](Synthetic_media "wikilink"). It marked the first time that
actors initiated a labor dispute in the U.S. since the [1980 actors
strike](1980_actors_strike "wikilink") and the first time that actors
and writers have walked out simultaneously since 1960.

Negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP took place from October 2
to October 11, and resumed on October 24. On November 8, 2023, a
tentative deal between the two sides was reached. Striking ended on
November 9 at 12:01 a.m. PST. On December 5, the SAG-AFTRA
membership officially ratified the contract with over 78% of members
voting in favor of it.

## Background

### Unionization in Hollywood

The Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio
Artists (SAG-AFTRA) is a [labor union](labor_union "wikilink") that
represents approximately 160,000 media professionals and
entertainers. The [Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers](Alliance_of_Motion_Picture_and_Television_Producers "wikilink")
(AMPTP) [trade association](trade_association "wikilink") represents
film and television studios in [collective
bargaining](collective_bargaining "wikilink") negotiations with unions
such as SAG-AFTRA, the [Directors Guild of
America](Directors_Guild_of_America "wikilink") (DGA), and [Writers
Guild of America, East](Writers_Guild_of_America,_East "wikilink") and
[Writers Guild of America
West](Writers_Guild_of_America_West "wikilink"), comprising the Writers
Guild of America (WGA). SAG-AFTRA was formed by the merger of the
[Screen Actors Guild](Screen_Actors_Guild "wikilink") (SAG) and the
[American Federation of Television and Radio
Artists](American_Federation_of_Television_and_Radio_Artists "wikilink")
(AFTRA) in March 2012, allowing SAG-AFTRA to represent not only actors,
but also journalists, talk show hosts, and other broadcast workers.
The WGA and the Screen Actors Guild have not simultaneously been on
strike since 1960, when actors [joined striking
writers](1960_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike "wikilink") over [residual
payments](residual_(entertainment_industry) "wikilink") from films sold
to television networks. The [1980 actors
strike](1980_actors_strike "wikilink") involved the combined efforts of
SAG and AFTRA. The largest SAG-AFTRA strike since 1980 occurred in
2000, in which commercial actors [went on
strike](2000_commercial_actors_strike "wikilink") to push for a
continuation of the residual system against advertiser backlash, amidst
the divisions between SAG and AFTRA.

During the last decade and the rise of streaming, writers and actors
have been frustrated over studio policy regarding residuals from
[streaming services](Streaming_media "wikilink"); the decline of network
television has led to a stronger reliance on other residuals. The
[2007–08 WGA strike](2007–08_WGA_strike "wikilink") was motivated in
large part by studio executives insisting that writers should receive no
residuals from streaming services. The 2007–08 strike cost the city
of [Los Angeles](Los_Angeles "wikilink") an estimated billion, according
to [NPR](NPR "wikilink"). As with striking WGA writers, actors have
expressed concerns about the use of [artificial
intelligence](artificial_intelligence "wikilink"), noting that it could
be used to replicate their likeness without compensation.

### Pre-strike activity

Weeks after the [Writers Guild of
America](Writers_Guild_of_America "wikilink") went [on
strike](Strike_action "wikilink") in May 2023, SAG-AFTRA's national
board of directors unanimously agreed to pursue a strike authorization
vote ahead of a renewed contract; SAG-AFTRA approved a new contract in
2020 that would expire on June 30, 2023. The union stated that it
did not intend to strike but that it sought to give its negotiators
"maximum bargaining leverage" ahead of negotiations on June 7, 2023.
SAG-AFTRA cited several issues in negotiations, including "economic
fairness, residuals, regulating the use of artificial intelligence and
alleviating the burdens of the industry-wide shift to self-taping", and
told its members that the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers would cut actors' salaries to "pad corporate profits". In
a video released on May 30, 2023, SAG-AFTRA members [Julia
Louis-Dreyfus](Julia_Louis-Dreyfus "wikilink"), [Jean
Smart](Jean_Smart "wikilink"), and [Kumail
Nanjiani](Kumail_Nanjiani "wikilink") appealed to members to vote to
strike but reserved that a vote for strike authorization was solely a
bargaining tool, not a vote to order an immediate strike.

On June 5, 2023, SAG-AFTRA approved the strike authorization by a 98%
margin, according to the union. High-profile members—including
[Quinta Brunson](Quinta_Brunson "wikilink"), [Jennifer
Lawrence](Jennifer_Lawrence "wikilink"), and [Rami
Malek](Rami_Malek "wikilink")—signaled their willingness to strike
ahead of the deadline to achieve a "transformative deal", despite
"extremely productive" negotiations. SAG-AFTRA agreed to extend
negotiations to midnight on July 13, 2023, in an attempt to avoid a
strike, but negotiations broke down in July 2023. SAG-AFTRA surveyed
members on a strike on July 5, 2023 and began preparing [picket
signs](Picketing "wikilink") two days later.

The AMPTP agreed to a "last-minute request" for mediation from the
[Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service](Federal_Mediation_and_Conciliation_Service_(United_States) "wikilink")
on July 11, 2023; congressional and public affairs director Greg Raelson
stated that a federal mediator would be present the following day. In
turn, SAG-AFTRA accused the AMPTP of attempting to extend negotiations
beyond the deadline and reiterated that it would not continue
negotiating after July 12, 2023. A number of high-profile actors,
including Lawrence and Malek, then affirmed their support again by
signing a letter urging the union to take aggressive measures and
stating their willingness to strike. It was later reported by
*[Variety](Variety_(magazine) "wikilink")* that mediation collapsed
after AMPTP President Carol Lombardini insulted negotiators by telling
them to "be civilized" and avert a strike, which prompted a walkout by
union negotiators. In response to Lombardini's comment, SAG-AFTRA
president [Fran Drescher](Fran_Drescher "wikilink") reportedly said to
AMPTP negotiators "Now you've got two unions on strike" as they
left.

On July 12, a statement was made announcing the construction of a *[Fast
& Furious](Fast_&_Furious "wikilink")*-themed [roller
coaster](roller_coaster "wikilink"); the date of the announcement
coincided with the deadline SAG-AFTRA gave before ending negotiations
with the AMPTP, and construction began by the strike's start. This added
to the construction that began on May 8, shortly after the WGA began
protesting on-site, obstructing Lankershim Boulevard along the west end
of the park's campus and parking lot and further restricting sidewalk
access. The sidewalks in front of Gates 1, 2, 4, and 5 would be
scaffolded-off and demolished in this construction. Despite
prior advice from the [Los Angeles Police
Department](Los_Angeles_Police_Department "wikilink")'s Labor Relations
Unit to place [K-rails](K-rails "wikilink") from River Road to Universal
Hollywood Drive for the safety of protesters and other pedestrians since
WGA protests as early as June 6, none were placed by July 18, by which
time reports of two protesters being struck by vehicles had been
made.

On July 13, with no agreement between SAG-AFTRA and the [Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television
Producers](Alliance_of_Motion_Picture_and_Television_Producers "wikilink")
(AMPTP), the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee voted unanimously to
recommend a strike to the union's national board. The national board
held a vote officially approving the strike. SAG-AFTRA president
[Fran Drescher](Fran_Drescher "wikilink") announced the strike would
begin at midnight on July 14; the cast of
*[Oppenheimer](Oppenheimer_(film) "wikilink")* left the film's London
premiere ahead of the announcement to walk out. Joined by chief
negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, Drescher asserted that the
strike was a reluctant last resort and described the proposed
contract as "moving around furniture on the
*[Titanic](Titanic "wikilink")*." In the press conference,
Crabtree-Ireland alleged that the AMPTP attempted to include a proposal
that allowed studios to, for a one-time fee equivalent to one day's pay,
have exclusive and indefinite rights to
[extras](Extra_(acting) "wikilink")' likenesses, including the use of
[generative AI](Generative_artificial_intelligence "wikilink") to
replicate them on screen. Media commentators likened this to the
film *[The Congress](The_Congress_(2013_film) "wikilink")* (2013) and
the *[Black Mirror](Black_Mirror "wikilink")* sixth series episode
"[Joan Is Awful](Joan_Is_Awful "wikilink")" (2023). However,
AMPTP denied these claims, stating that their proposal would allow usage
of these replicas within the specific film for which they are employed,
and that any other uses would require consent and further
compensation.

## Timeline of negotiations and strike activity

### July 2023

The strike officially began on July 14. As part of the rules
established on July 10, actors cannot engage in film or television
productions and cannot take part in promotional work, such as [press
junkets](press_junket "wikilink"), film premieres, and events—including
[San Diego Comic-Con](San_Diego_Comic-Con "wikilink"), which was
scheduled for July 20–23. The strike action does not apply to
SAG-AFTRA members who work under contracts that are negotiated by the
union separately from the AMPTP contract, including broadcast
journalists. Work in podcasts, "micro-budget" independent films, and
student films is allowed, as is "unscripted" television work such as
game shows, reality competition shows, documentaries, and talk
shows. Internationally, SAG-AFTRA members are authorized to continue
work in the United Kingdom under pre-established
[Equity](Equity_(British_trade_union) "wikilink") collective bargaining
agreements, as UK law criminalizes [solidarity
strikes](Solidarity_action "wikilink"). The HBO series *[House of
the Dragon](House_of_the_Dragon "wikilink")* thus continued its UK-based
filming with SAG-AFTRA actors operating under Equity contracts,
prompting backlash among fans of the series.

On July 17, the [Ficus trees](Ficus_tree "wikilink") on Barham
Boulevard's sidewalk outside Gate 8 were [pruned](pruned "wikilink")
almost entirely of their leaves. [Pine trees](Pine_tree "wikilink")
on the opposite side of Barham were not touched, nor were a row of
[pepper trees](pepper_tree "wikilink") behind the fence near the
production gate. The pruning was described as a vindictive action
because the trees had been being used by protesters as shade from the
over 90 °F (32 °C) summer temperatures of Southern California. The
pruning was also described as illegal, on the grounds that the trees are
owned by the city and that Los Angeles' tree ordinances prohibit
trimming them between July and September. NBCUniversal
issued a statement to *[Deadline
Hollywood](Deadline_Hollywood "wikilink")* denying that the trimming was
done out of malice, claiming that they trim the trees outside the park
in July annually for safety, and describing it and the obstructive
construction hazards as "unintended challenges for demonstrators".
NBCUniversal was fined US$250 for violating tree laws and destroying
city property.

Also on July 17, SAG-AFTRA released a twelve-page statement outlining
the breakdown in negotiations, and terms they found unacceptable,
including but not limited to a five-percent salary increase for actors,
while the union had asked for eleven percent. The AMPTP released a
counter-statement, highlighting that its actions were being
"deliberately distort\[ed\]" and that SAG-AFTRA had chosen to pass over
"the most lucrative deal we have ever negotiated... valued at $318
million over the three-year term of the contract."

On July 18, [NBCUniversal](NBCUniversal "wikilink") was accused of
conducting business at [Universal Studios
Hollywood](Universal_Studios_Hollywood "wikilink") to deter or endanger
the protesters and infringe on their rights to protest. In
response, SAG-AFTRA and WGA issued a joint grievance to the National
Labor Relations Board against NBCUniversal, accusing the company of
interfering with their freedom to picket and endangering their
members. [Writers Guild of America
West](Writers_Guild_of_America_West "wikilink") additionally filed a
petition to the AMPTP in response to NBCUniversal's failure to install
barriers to protect WGA and SAG-AFTRA protestors from the risk of being
forced into traffic. NBCUniversal responded to *[The
Hollywood Reporter](The_Hollywood_Reporter "wikilink")* in a statement:
"We are aware of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA complaints. We strongly believe
that the company has fulfilled our legal obligations under the National
Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and we will cooperate with respect to any
inquiries by the National Labor Relations Board on this issue. While we
understand the timing of our multi-year construction project has created
challenges for demonstrators, we continue to work with public agencies
to increase access. We support the unions' rights to demonstrate
safely."

On July 19, 2023, SAG-AFTRA approved more films to be shot during the
strike, including [Ishana Night
Shyamalan](Ishana_Night_Shyamalan "wikilink")'s *[The
Watchers](The_Watchers_(film) "wikilink")*, [Sam
Raimi](Sam_Raimi "wikilink")'s *[Don't
Move](Don't_Move_(upcoming_film) "wikilink")*, and [David
Lowery](David_Lowery_(director) "wikilink")'s *[Mother
Mary](Mother_Mary_(upcoming_film) "wikilink")*. 56 films then became
eligible to shoot under strike rules.

On July 25, 2023, thousands of actors rallied Tuesday morning at Times
Square from 9:30 A.M. to noon to voice their concerns about fair
treatment and wages. SAG-AFTRA's main contractual negotiator, Duncan
Crabtree-Ireland spoke about the struggle that the union is facing with
the AMPTP. Many celebrities gave speeches to express their concerns
about the future of their union and technological advancements in the
industry. In attendance were: [Lauren
Ambrose](Lauren_Ambrose "wikilink"), [Matt
Bomer](Matt_Bomer "wikilink"), [Christine
Baranski](Christine_Baranski "wikilink"), [Steve
Buscemi](Steve_Buscemi "wikilink"), [Bobby
Cannavale](Bobby_Cannavale "wikilink"), [Tituss
Burgess](Tituss_Burgess "wikilink"), [Liza
Colón-Zayas](Liza_Colón-Zayas "wikilink"), [Bryan
Cranston](Bryan_Cranston "wikilink"), [Jessica
Chastain](Jessica_Chastain "wikilink"), Gregory Diaz, [Jennifer
Ehle](Jennifer_Ehle "wikilink"), [Brendan
Fraser](Brendan_Fraser "wikilink"), [Nancy
Giles](Nancy_Giles "wikilink"), [Danai Gurira](Danai_Gurira "wikilink"),
[Jill Hennessy](Jill_Hennessy "wikilink"), [Marin
Hinkle](Marin_Hinkle "wikilink"), [Stephen
Lang](Stephen_Lang "wikilink"), [Arian Moayed](Arian_Moayed "wikilink"),
[Christopher Meloni](Christopher_Meloni "wikilink"), [Chloë Grace
Moretz](Chloë_Grace_Moretz "wikilink"), [Wendell
Pierce](Wendell_Pierce "wikilink"), [Michael
Shannon](Michael_Shannon "wikilink"), [Christian
Slater](Christian_Slater "wikilink"), [Corey
Stoll](Corey_Stoll "wikilink"), [Merritt
Wever](Merritt_Wever "wikilink") and [Rachel
Zegler](Rachel_Zegler "wikilink").

### August 2023

Picketing was called off for one day, August 21, 2023, due to [Hurricane
Hilary](Hurricane_Hilary "wikilink").

### September 2023

On September 1, the SAG-AFTRA National Board voted to send the video
game strike authorization vote to its members, and on September
25, the results showed the authorization passed with 98.32% voting in
favor.

After the WGA and AMPTP reached a tentative agreement on September 24,
leading to the [official end of the WGA strike on September
27](2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike#September_2023 "wikilink"),
SAG-AFTRA announced that it remains on strike, and called for renewed
negotiations with the AMPTP. Later on September 27, SAG-AFTRA
and AMPTP made a joint announcement that "SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP will
resume negotiations for a new TV/Theatrical contract on Monday, October
2."

### October 2023

On October 2, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP met for negotiations, in the
first meeting between the two unions since the SAG-AFTRA strike began on
July 14. Unlike the WGA's negotiations, the SAG-AFTRA's negotiations
were held at SAG-AFTRA's headquarters on [Wilshire
Boulevard](Wilshire_Boulevard "wikilink") rather than the AMPTP's
headquarters in [Sherman Oaks](Sherman_Oaks "wikilink") as, according to
*Deadline*, SAG-AFTRA officials were displeased "with the AMPTP's setup"
and wanted a change of scenery. Participants included AMPTP chief
Carol Lombardini, [Donna Langley](Donna_Langley "wikilink")
([NBCUniversal](NBCUniversal "wikilink")), [David
Zaslav](David_Zaslav "wikilink") ([Warner Bros.
Discovery](Warner_Bros._Discovery "wikilink")), [Ted
Sarandos](Ted_Sarandos "wikilink") ([Netflix](Netflix "wikilink")), [Bob
Iger](Bob_Iger "wikilink")
([Disney](The_Walt_Disney_Company "wikilink")), as well as SAG-AFTRA's
[Fran Drescher](Fran_Drescher "wikilink"), Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, and
Ray Rodriguez. The meeting concluded with an announcement that they
would meet again on the 4th. This pattern continued from October
4 to 9, when a joint statement announced a meeting on October
11. However, negotiations broke down on October 11.

Beginning October 12, numerous reasons were given as to why negotiations
stopped. Sarandos said that talks broke down because SAG-AFTRA
"introduced a levy on subscribers on top of \[other\] areas" which he
said was "a bridge too far." However, SAG-AFTRA accused the AMPTP
of using "bully tactics", with SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher,
stating that the AMPTP "had given us a proposal package. We worked for
like 36 hours on it. We brought it back to them. We walked them through
it and they left and then called a few hours later and said, 'We're
breaking negotiations.'" Drescher has also said that SAG-AFTRA
wants to continue negotiations. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland
(SAG-AFTRA) also responded stating that, "the public statement from the
CEOs in their press release from the AMPTP characterized our demands as
excessive. But really we don't think they are. The numbers they've been
using are wildly overstated."

On October 16, SAG-AFTRA announced that it will schedule negotiations
regarding a new video game contract.

On October 19, *[Deadline Hollywood](Deadline_Hollywood "wikilink")*
reported that a [Zoom](Zoom_(software) "wikilink") call between
Hollywood stars ([George Clooney](George_Clooney "wikilink"), [Scarlett
Johansson](Scarlett_Johansson "wikilink"), [Kerry
Washington](Kerry_Washington "wikilink"), [Tyler
Perry](Tyler_Perry "wikilink"), [Bradley
Cooper](Bradley_Cooper "wikilink"), [Meryl
Streep](Meryl_Streep "wikilink"), [Jennifer
Aniston](Jennifer_Aniston "wikilink"), [Robert De
Niro](Robert_De_Niro "wikilink"), [Ben Affleck](Ben_Affleck "wikilink"),
[Laura Dern](Laura_Dern "wikilink"), [Emma
Stone](Emma_Stone "wikilink"), [Reese
Witherspoon](Reese_Witherspoon "wikilink"), [Ryan
Reynolds](Ryan_Reynolds "wikilink"), and [Ariana
DeBose](Ariana_DeBose "wikilink")) and SAG-AFTRA leaders introduced
a proposal that "amounts to the town's biggest earners defraying the
costs to AMPTP signatories by eliminating the cap on membership dues, to
be used to bolster health benefits and other areas that SAG-AFTRA is
trying to shore up. The offer would remove the $1 million cap on
membership dues," and ultimately would have brought $150 million over
three years. While Crabtree-Ireland found the proposal "worthy of
review and consideration" as "someone wanting to help is not someone
wanting to undermine," Drescher ultimately rejected the offer,
saying that it is not feasible. She instead called upon the AMPTP to
resume negotiations with SAG-AFTRA.

On October 20, actress and [former SAG
president](SAG-AFTRA#Leadership_history "wikilink") [Melissa
Gilbert](Melissa_Gilbert "wikilink") dismissed a message from SAG-AFTRA
stating that actors should not wear [Halloween
costumes](Halloween_costume "wikilink") of characters from "struck
companies," and said: "THIS is what you guys come up with?
Literally no one cares what anyone wears for Halloween ... do you really
think this kind of infantile stuff is going to end the strike? ...
please tell me you're going to make this rule go away... and go
negotiate!... people are suffering mightily... this is the kind of silly
bullshit that keeps us on strike."

On October 21, a joint statement announced that negotiations would
resume on October 24, 2023. After a full day of negotiations
on the 24th, the initial plan of meeting on October 25 was moved to
October 26. Negotiations thus resumed on October 26, with
Crabtree-Ireland stating that they are "100% focused on making a fair
deal at the table ... I am cautiously optimistic that can happen. I
don't really want to characterize what's going on in the room but we're
really focused on just staying prepared and focused on getting the
negotiations done." An individual also speculated to *The Wrap*
that "studios believe that if they can't reach a deal in the next week
with the Screen Actors Guild, which has been on strike since July 14,
then no new production will be able to start before 2024." After
the meeting, they announced that negotiations will continue on October
27. Also on October 26, a public letter signed by thousands of
high-profile actors was sent to the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee
encouraging them to keep fighting for their values rather than cave in
to the studios' demands, saying, "As hard as this is, we would rather
stay on strike than take a bad deal."

On October 27, 2023, negotiations continued, but no deal was made, and
it was announced that talks will continue over the weekend. The four
studio CEOs did not attend the meeting, and Lombardini attended in their
stead. The meeting on October 28 was conducted virtually
between SAG-AFTRA leaders Drescher, Crabtree-Ireland and the SAG-AFTRA
negotiating committee, with the guild awaiting a response from the
studios, and plans to meet again on October 29.

Then, after intermittent communications on October 29, a guild source
told *[Deadline Hollywood](Deadline_Hollywood "wikilink")* that there
"is a feeling of optimism... looks like we're in the final
stretch." *Deadline* also states that "both sides expressed
confidence a deal may be reached within days, but as before cautioned
the situation is still fluid. From our understanding, SAG-AFTRA and the
studios have gained 'significant' traction on bridging their gap over
what has been termed as success-based compensation for streaming shows
and their casts." Late in the evening SAG-AFTRA stated: "Both
parties will be working independently Monday and re-engage on scheduling
at the end of the day." The next day, Crabtree-Ireland informed
*Deadline* that the weekend talks were "productive," and he continues to
remain "cautiously optimistic about making progress." Also according to
*Deadline*, he said that SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP are "not just 'dotting I's
and crossing T's' just yet... He added that AI is the current focus of
talks." Later in the afternoon a "well-positioned individual"
told *Deadline Hollywood* that "There's still a lot of work to be
done." Another source told *Deadline*, "there's a lot of common
ground now, and we are building on that... details still have to be
determined, but we're heading in the right direction." That
evening, SAG-AFTRA released a statement saying they would meet again on
October 31.

On October 31, talks ended early out of consideration of families
celebrating [Halloween](Halloween "wikilink"), with the intention to
meet again on November 1, and with plans to have further meetings later
in the week if needed.

### November 2023

Meetings continued from November 1 to November 3. On
November 4, SAG-AFTRA lead negotiators stated that they "received an
offer today from the AMPTP, which they characterized as their 'Last,
Best, and Final Offer' ... we are reviewing it and considering our
response within the context of the critical issues addressed in our
proposals." On November 5, SAG-AFTRA sent a statement to its
members saying that the negotiating team had "analyzed and thoroughly
discussed the AMPTP's counter proposal all day and well into the night
and will continue our deliberations on Monday." On November 6,
SAG-AFTRA sent a letter to members that said: "This morning our
negotiators formally responded to the AMPTP's 'Last, Best & Final' offer
... there are several essential items on which we still do not have an
agreement, including AI." Later that evening, *Deadline Hollywood*
reported that the virtual meeting ended late, with plans to continue
negotiations. A studio insider told *Deadline* that, "this was a
productive session, some work still required before there's a
deal." On November 7, SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP met again. A "guild
source" told *Deadline Hollywood* that they "are very close ... not done
yet, but very close with strong protection language in place." However,
the meeting ended without a deal, and with plans to continue talking on
November 8. In addition, *Deadline Hollywood* reported that it
"heard from several sources that guild president Fran Drescher was
pinged by A-list stars asking about whether a deal was nigh." Also
on November 7, [Tyler Perry](Tyler_Perry "wikilink") gave an interview
on *[CBS Mornings](CBS_Mornings "wikilink").* While praising the
SAG-AFTRA lead negotiators, he also stated that the work stoppage has
been "debilitating," and that "it's really important to know when we've
won. This is only a three-year deal. In two years, two-and-a-half years,
we'll be renegotiating again ... so we have to know what have we won,
and what have we won for now? That's the thing. For now. \[...\] If I
had ran my business trying to get everything at once, I wouldn't be
here. I've got as much as I can for now, so let's see what we can do
next."

On November 8, 2023, SAG-AFTRA released a statement to its members that
announced the end of the strike: "We are thrilled and proud to tell you
that today your TV/Theatrical Negotiating Committee voted unanimously to
approve a tentative agreement with the AMPTP. As of 12:01am on November
9, our strike is officially suspended and all picket locations are
closed." The SAG-AFTRA's National Board committee then
approved the agreement by a majority of 86%. The summary of the
agreement was published on November 13, 2023. Voting among
SAG-AFTRA members began on November 14.

### December 2023

Voting concluded on December 5. The deal was approved with
78.33% support, with a 38.15% turnout.

## Strike activity and responses

### Locations

SAG-AFTRA's strikes in Los Angeles targeted the major film studios as
well as offices for companies. Drescher personally joined the strikes
outside of Netflix's offices. [Josh Gad](Josh_Gad "wikilink") was among
the protestors at [Fox Entertainment](Fox_Entertainment "wikilink")'s
picket lines. [Allison Janney](Allison_Janney "wikilink"), [Kaitlyn
Dever](Kaitlyn_Dever "wikilink"), [Logan
Lerman](Logan_Lerman "wikilink"), and [Joey King](Joey_King "wikilink")
joined protests at [Warner Bros.](Warner_Bros. "wikilink"), and
actresses [Constance Zimmer](Constance_Zimmer "wikilink") and [Ginnifer
Goodwin](Ginnifer_Goodwin "wikilink") took part in picket lines at
Paramount's Los Angeles studios. Disney's offices saw picket lines whose
notable members included [Mandy Moore](Mandy_Moore "wikilink"),
[Michelle Monaghan](Michelle_Monaghan "wikilink"),
[Raini](Raini_Rodriguez "wikilink") and [Rico
Rodriguez](Rico_Rodriguez_(actor) "wikilink"), [Danielle
Fishel](Danielle_Fishel "wikilink"), and [Ben
Schwartz](Ben_Schwartz "wikilink").

SAG-AFTRA's New York picketing action took place at Paramount's New York
headquarters at 1515 Broadway and various offices of NBCUniversal,
including [Rockefeller Center](Rockefeller_Center "wikilink"). [Jason
Sudeikis](Jason_Sudeikis "wikilink") joined the NBCUniversal picket
lines, stating that actors would strike for "as long as it takes", as
did [Joe Pantoliano](Joe_Pantoliano "wikilink"), the [Naked
Cowboy](Naked_Cowboy "wikilink"), [Alex
Edelman](Alex_Edelman "wikilink"), and [Sarah
Sherman](Sarah_Sherman "wikilink"). Meanwhile, at Paramount's
headquarters, picket lines included [Michael
Schur](Michael_Schur "wikilink") and [Kevin
Bacon](Kevin_Bacon "wikilink").

SAG-AFTRA also staged brief strikes at other locations outside of New
York and Los Angeles. Branded as "Quick Photo Op" strikes, these took
place in Orlando, Honolulu, and Atlanta. The union stated it plans to
launch more protests across the country, requesting that SAG-AFTRA
members contact their local executives for details.

### Media executives' response

Before the end of SAG-AFTRA's negotiations, one yet-to-be-named AMPTP
executive stated that their current strategy was to "allow things to
drag on until union members \[started\] losing their apartments and
losing their houses" to force SAG-AFTRA into less favorable negotiating
positions.

Casey Bloys, CEO of [HBO](HBO "wikilink") and
[Max](Max_(streaming_service) "wikilink"), said the strike "will slow
everything down." He predicted the strike would heavily affect HBO's
2024 season.

[Bob Iger](Bob_Iger "wikilink"), the CEO of [The Walt Disney
Company](The_Walt_Disney_Company "wikilink"), said the actors' demands
were "not realistic", adding they were "adding to the set of challenges
that this business is already facing". Iger has been criticized for
these remarks in light of his contract with Disney, which allows him to
earn as much as $27 million in 2023 between his salary and bonuses.
*[TheWrap](TheWrap "wikilink")* wrote Iger makes over 500 times the
[median](median "wikilink") salary of Disney employees, while *[Town &
Country](Town_&_Country_(magazine) "wikilink")* wrote it was actually
1,242 times a Disney employee's median salary. When asked
about Iger's remarks, Drescher described them as "repugnant" and "tone
deaf." She went on to call Iger a "land baron" who "has no idea about
what is really happening". The *Wall Street Journal* also called
Iger "tone deaf". Actor [Bryan Cranston](Bryan_Cranston "wikilink")
responded to Iger in part: "We will not be having our jobs taken away
and given to robots."

### Politicians' response

U.S. President [Joe Biden](Joe_Biden "wikilink"), Vermont U.S. senator
[Bernie Sanders](Bernie_Sanders "wikilink"), and [Mayor of Los
Angeles](Mayor_of_Los_Angeles "wikilink") [Karen
Bass](Karen_Bass "wikilink") have voiced their support for the actors'
union. Biden had previously supported the writers on strike in May
2023. Some politicians joined the picket lines themselves,
including [Burbank](Burbank,_California "wikilink") mayor [Konstantine
Anthony](Konstantine_Anthony "wikilink") (himself a SAG-AFTRA member)
and California U.S. Representative [Adam
Schiff](Adam_Schiff "wikilink"). U.S. Representative
[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez "wikilink") joined
the picket line in front of Netflix studios in New York City. She
criticized the wealth of studio executives while the average
screenwriter or actor struggles to get access to healthcare, and she
emphasized the power of [direct action](direct_action "wikilink") in
achieving economic victories.

Both Bass and [Governor of
California](Governor_of_California "wikilink") [Gavin
Newsom](Gavin_Newsom "wikilink") have offered to help
[mediate](mediation "wikilink") an end to the strikes.

### Other unions' response

Numerous other labor unions in the United States expressed support for
the strike. Along with the Writers' Guild, statements of support were
released by the [Directors Guild](Directors_Guild_of_America "wikilink")
and [Producers Guild](Producers_Guild_of_America "wikilink"). The
[International Brotherhood of
Teamsters](International_Brotherhood_of_Teamsters "wikilink"), itself in
a contractual dispute with [UPS](United_Parcel_Service "wikilink")
and scheduled to go on strike at the end of July if no deal is reached,
expressed support through a statement released by their president, [Sean
O'Brien](Sean_O'Brien_(labor_leader) "wikilink"). The
[AFL–CIO](AFL–CIO "wikilink") additionally threw their support behind
SAG-AFTRA, as did the [Department for Professional
Employees](Department_for_Professional_Employees,_AFL–CIO "wikilink"),
the [International Alliance of Theatrical Stage
Employees](International_Alliance_of_Theatrical_Stage_Employees "wikilink"),
and the [Writers Guild of America,
East](Writers_Guild_of_America,_East "wikilink").

### Other organizations' response

Two forthcoming film festivals, the [Toronto International Film
Festival](Toronto_International_Film_Festival "wikilink") and the
[Venice International Film
Festival](Venice_International_Film_Festival "wikilink"), have
acknowledged the potential impact of the strike and its associated ban
on promotional appearances by actors if the strike is not resolved by
September but have indicated that both events will proceed regardless,
with an increase of Canadian, European, Asian, and South American titles
in all sections being expected. However, leaders of SAG-AFTRA
had been adamant that actors in movies with interim agreements should be
at festivals to promote them.

### Impacted productions

On October 30, 2023, the *[Hunger
Games](Hunger_Games_(franchise) "wikilink")* prequel film *[The Hunger
Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &
Snakes](The_Hunger_Games:_The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_&_Snakes "wikilink")*
was given an interim agreement so that actors could promote the film
during the strike.

#### Lucasfilm Animation Singapore

On August 15, 2023, Lucasfilm announced that it would be shutting down
its [Singapore
operations](Lucasfilm_Animation#Lucasfilm_Animation_Singapore "wikilink").
Disney explained that the shutdown was due to economic factors, with the
SAG-AFTRA strike in the United States affecting the industry's
work.
