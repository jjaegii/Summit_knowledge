## Plot

On Earth-65, police captain [George Stacy](George_Stacy "wikilink") is
unaware that his daughter [Gwen
Stacy](Gwen_Stacy_(Spider-Verse) "wikilink") is Spider-Woman, whom the
police were hunting after. George in particular aims to arrest
Spider-Woman for the murder of [Peter Parker](Peter_Parker "wikilink"),
not knowing that Gwen killed him in self defense after he turned into
[the Lizard](Lizard_(character) "wikilink"). One night, Gwen encounters
a version of the [Vulture](Vulture_(Marvel_Comics) "wikilink") from an
[Italian Renaissance](Italian_Renaissance "wikilink")–themed alternate
universe. [Miguel O'Hara](Spider-Man_2099 "wikilink") and [Jess
Drew](Spider-Woman_(Jessica_Drew) "wikilink") arrive using
portal-generating watches and help Gwen neutralize the Vulture. George
corners Gwen, who then reveals her identity to him; distraught, he
attempts to arrest her. Miguel reluctantly grants Gwen membership into
the Spider-Society, allowing her to escape with him and Jess.

In [Brooklyn](Brooklyn "wikilink") on Earth-1610, sixteen months after
the [Alchemax](Alchemax "wikilink") collider's explosion, [Miles
Morales](Miles_Morales_(Spider-Verse) "wikilink") encounters [the
Spot](Spot_(comics) "wikilink"), an Alchemax scientist whose body was
infused with portals during the explosion. The Spot blames Miles for
causing his mutation and reveals that, while testing the collider, he
had transported a spider from another dimension, Earth-42, which then
bit Miles and turned him into Spider-Man. The Spot then accidentally
transports himself into a void, where he learns to travel to other
universes, find Alchemax colliders and empower himself further.

Gwen travels to Earth-1610 and reconnects with Miles while tracking the
Spot, having traveled to Earth-50101, one of the universes with an
active Alchemax collider. Miles secretly follows her through the portal
to Mumbattan, and they team up with that world's local Spider-Man
[Pavitr Prabhakar](Spider-Man_(Pavitr_Prabhakar) "wikilink"), and later
[Hobie Brown](Spider-Punk "wikilink"), against the Spot, who absorbs the
power of that world's collider. The Spot and Miles share a vision of the
Spot's future attacks, which include the deaths of Police Inspector
Singh, the father of Pavitr's girlfriend Gayatri, and Miles' father
[Jeff](Jefferson_Davis_(comics) "wikilink"). The Spot departs, and the
collider collapses; Miles saves Singh from the ensuing destruction, but
Earth-50101 begins to fall apart from its disrupted
"[canon](Canon_(fiction) "wikilink") event" before members of the
Society arrive to contain the damage. Miles, Gwen, and Hobie are sent to
the Society's headquarters on Nueva York in Earth-928, where hundreds of
Spider-People gather and reside in a massive complex.

Miles, along with Gwen and Hobie, meets with Miguel and reunites with
[Peter B. Parker](Peter_B._Parker_(Spider-Verse) "wikilink"), who is
accompanied by his infant daughter
[Mayday](Spider-Girl_(Mayday_Parker) "wikilink"). Miguel explains to
Miles that each of the Spider-People's stories throughout the multiverse
contains "canon events", such as the deaths of a police captain close to
Spider-Man, deaths of an uncle-figure to Spider-Man, or other string of
events that define a Spider-Man, and that straying from these events
threatens reality and may cause that universe to collapse, which in turn
could collapse the entire multiverse as a consequence. Miguel reveals
that he witnessed the collapse of another universe firsthand when
attempting to replace a deceased version of himself from that universe.

Miles realizes that the Spot murdering Jeff, who is set to be promoted
to police captain in two days, is a canon event. Miguel imprisons Miles
to prevent him from saving Jeff, but Hobie helps Miles break loose
before quitting the Society. As Miles flees through the complex, Miguel
orders the Society to capture him. Miguel corners Miles and tells him he
was never supposed to be Spider-Man, as Earth-42 has no Spider-Man, and
that if Earth-42's spider had not bitten Miles, Earth-1610's Peter
Parker would have survived, and the Spot would never have existed. Miles
overpowers Miguel and with the help from [Margo
Kess](Alternative_versions_of_Spider-Man#Spider-Byte_(Earth-22191) "wikilink"),
flees to what he believes is his home dimension. Considering Gwen a
liability, a furious Miguel ejects her from the Society and forcibly
sends her back to Earth-65. Once there, Gwen reunites with George, who
has resigned from his job as police captain. The two reconcile, and
George gives Gwen a portal watch left behind by Hobie.

As the Society begins their search for Miles in Earth-1610, Gwen and
Miles realizes that Miles has arrived on Earth-42 rather than his own
dimension. In this world, his uncle [Aaron
Davis](Prowler_(Aaron_Davis) "wikilink") is alive while his father is
dead; New York City is riddled with unchecked crime. Miles was knocked
unconscious and finds himself restrained by Aaron, and Earth-42's
version of [The Prowler](Prowler_(Marvel_Comics) "wikilink"), who is
revealed to be Miles. Meanwhile, Gwen speaks with Miles' parents,
promising to find him and bring him home. As The Spot begins his
multiversal attack on Earth-1610's New York, Miles prepares to make his
escape from his restraints, and Gwen assembles a team to find Miles,
consisting of Peter B., Mayday, Pavitr, Hobie, Margo, [Spider-Man
Noir](Spider-Man_Noir "wikilink"), [Peni
Parker](Peni_Parker "wikilink"), and
[Spider-Ham](Spider-Ham "wikilink").

## Production

### Development

By the end of November 2018, ahead of the release of *[Spider-Man: Into
the Spider-Verse](Spider-Man:_Into_the_Spider-Verse "wikilink")* (2018)
the following month, [Sony Pictures
Animation](Sony_Pictures_Animation "wikilink") had begun developing a
sequel[67] due to the "incredible buzz" surrounding the project.[68] The
sequel was to continue the story of [Miles Morales /
Spider-Man](Miles_Morales_(Spider-Verse) "wikilink"),[69][70] working
from "seeds \[that were\] planted" throughout the first film.[71]
[Joaquim Dos Santos](Joaquim_Dos_Santos "wikilink") and [David
Callaham](David_Callaham "wikilink") were set to direct and write,
respectively, with [Amy Pascal](Amy_Pascal "wikilink") returning from
the first film as producer. The other producers of the first film—[Phil
Lord, Christopher Miller](Phil_Lord_and_Christopher_Miller "wikilink"),
[Avi Arad](Avi_Arad "wikilink"), and Christina Steinberg—were all also
expected to return in some capacities.[72] The next month, Pascal
revealed that the film would focus on Miles and [Gwen Stacy /
Spider-Woman](Gwen_Stacy_(Spider-Verse) "wikilink"), exploring a romance
between the characters that was cut from the first film, and that the
sequel would be a "launching pad" for a previously announced
female-focused spin-off film featuring Gwen.[73] Sony officially
confirmed the sequel in November 2019, with a release date of April 8,
2022, with Lord and Miller returning as producers.[74] In April 2020,
Sony shifted the film's release to October 7, 2022, due to the [COVID-19
pandemic](COVID-19_pandemic "wikilink").[75]

In February 2021, Miller said that he and Lord were working on the
film's screenplay with Callaham, and that [Peter
Ramsey](Peter_Ramsey "wikilink") would be an executive producer on the
sequel after co-directing the first film.[76] That April, [Kemp
Powers](Kemp_Powers "wikilink") and Justin K. Thompson were announced as
co-directors alongside Dos Santos, and that all three had worked on the
project since it began. (Thompson was production designer on the first
film.) Arad and Steinberg were confirmed to return as producers with
Lord, Miller and Pascal, with Alonzo Ruvalcaba co-producing and Aditya
Sood, *Into the Spider-Verse* directors [Bob
Persichetti](Bob_Persichetti "wikilink") and [Rodney
Rothman](Rodney_Rothman "wikilink"), and Rebecca Karch and [Brian
Michael Bendis](Brian_Michael_Bendis "wikilink") joining Ramsey as
executive producers.[77]

In December, Lord and Miller revealed that the film was being split into
two parts: *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One)* and *(Part
Two)*, because they had written the story they wanted to tell for the
sequel and realized it was too much for one film. Work on both parts was
taking place simultaneously.[78] The sequels were renamed in April 2022,
becoming *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse* and *Spider-Man: Beyond
the Spider-Verse*. Their release dates were shifted then, with *Across
the Spider-Verse* pushed back to June 2, 2023.[79][80][81] Lord and
Miller said that they had told Sony the sequel would be the same size as
*Into the Spider-Verse*, but it ended up having the largest crew of any
animated film ever, with around 1,000 people working on it. They added
that the film had 240 characters and would take place across six
universes.[82]

### Casting

Lord and Miller expressed interest in including
[Spider-Punk](Spider-Punk "wikilink"), [Takuya
Yamashiro](Spider-Man_(Takuya_Yamashiro) "wikilink"), the "Japanese
Spider-Man" from the [1978 *Spider-Man*
series](Spider-Man_(Japanese_TV_series) "wikilink"), and [Italian
Spiderman](Italian_Spiderman "wikilink") in the following movies.[83] In
November 2019, Lord indicated that the character Takuya Yamashiro was
designed, though he didn't make an appearance in the movie.[84] In
August 2020, [Jake Johnson](Jake_Johnson "wikilink") expressed hope that
he could reprise his role as [Peter B.
Parker](Peter_B._Parker_(Spider-Verse) "wikilink") from the first film
in the sequel.[85] [Issa Rae](Issa_Rae "wikilink") was cast as [Jess
Drew / Spider-Woman](Spider-Woman_(Jessica_Drew) "wikilink") in June
2021,[86] Johnson confirmed that he would be returning for the sequel a
month later,[87] and [Oscar Isaac](Oscar_Isaac "wikilink") was confirmed
in December to be reprising his role of [Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man
2099](Spider-Man_2099 "wikilink") from the post-credits scene of *Into
the Spider-Verse*.[88][89] Also in December, [Tom
Holland](Tom_Holland "wikilink")—who plays [Peter Parker /
Spider-Man](Peter_Parker_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) "wikilink") in the
[Marvel Cinematic
Universe](Marvel_Cinematic_Universe "wikilink")—revealed that Pascal had
approached him about appearing in the *Spider-Verse* films during the
filming of *[Spider-Man: No Way
Home](Spider-Man:_No_Way_Home "wikilink")* (2021). Holland and his
co-stars [Zendaya](Zendaya "wikilink") and [Jacob
Batalon](Jacob_Batalon "wikilink") all expressed interest in appearing
in the upcoming films.[90] Jeff Sneider of *[The
Ankler](Ankler_Media "wikilink")* claimed in February 2023 that Holland
would appear in a live-action sequence and that his appearance had been
the reason the movie was delayed from 2022 to 2023, though it turned out
to be false.[91] [Christopher Daniel
Barnes](Christopher_Daniel_Barnes "wikilink"), who voiced Spider-Man in
*[Spider-Man: The Animated
Series](Spider-Man_(1994_TV_series) "wikilink")* (1994–1998), also
expressed interest in returning for the film.[92]

In April 2022, [Brian Tyree Henry](Brian_Tyree_Henry "wikilink") and
[Luna Lauren Vélez](Lauren_Vélez "wikilink") were confirmed to be
reprising their roles as Miles' parents from the first film while
[Rachel Dratch](Rachel_Dratch "wikilink") was revealed to be voicing the
counselor at Miles' school.[93] Lord, Miller, and the directors
announced in June that [Jason Schwartzman](Jason_Schwartzman "wikilink")
would provide the voice of the film's main antagonist [Johnathon Ohnn /
the Spot](Spot_(comics) "wikilink"), which was added to the story after
a suggestion from producer Avi Arad (a second antagonist was later
written out of the movie).[94] Powers noted that the Spot was one of
"the deepest cuts in [Spider-Man's rogue
gallery](List_of_Spider-Man_enemies "wikilink")" but the creative team
was excited about his abilities, which allow the character to travel
between universes.[95] [Shea Whigham](Shea_Whigham "wikilink") and
[Jorma Taccone](Jorma_Taccone "wikilink") were also revealed to be
voicing [George Stacy](George_Stacy "wikilink") and the
[Vulture](Vulture_(Marvel_Comics) "wikilink"), respectively.[96] Taccone
previously voiced [Norman Osborn / Green
Goblin](Green_Goblin_(Ultimate_Marvel_character) "wikilink") and [Peter
Parker / Spider-Man from the 1967 TV
series](Spider-Man_(1967_TV_series) "wikilink") in *Into the
Spider-Verse*.[97][98] In November 2022, [Daniel
Kaluuya](Daniel_Kaluuya "wikilink") was confirmed to be voicing [Hobart
"Hobie" Brown / Spider-Punk](Spider-Punk "wikilink") in the film.[99] In
December 2022, with the reveal of the film's first poster, it was
confirmed that the [Peter Parker /
Spider-Man](List_of_The_Spectacular_Spider-Man_characters#Peter_Parker/Spider-Man "wikilink")
from *[The Spectacular
Spider-Man](The_Spectacular_Spider-Man_(TV_series) "wikilink")*
(2008–2009) would appear in the film.[100] *Spectacular* showrunner
[Greg Weisman](Greg_Weisman "wikilink") was not informed about the
inclusion of his show's character and expressed doubts he would even be
featured in the film itself.[101] In January 2023, [Nicolas
Cage](Nicolas_Cage "wikilink") confirmed he would not be reprising his
role of [Spider-Man Noir](Spider-Man_Noir "wikilink") for the film.[102]
In February 2023, it was revealed that [Karan
Soni](Karan_Soni "wikilink") was cast as [Pavitr Prabhakar / Spider-Man
India](Spider-Man_(Pavitr_Prabhakar) "wikilink") in the film.[103] In
April 2023, it was reported that [Andy Samberg](Andy_Samberg "wikilink")
was playing [Ben Reilly](Ben_Reilly "wikilink") / [Scarlet
Spider](Scarlet_Spider "wikilink").[104] A report confirmed his casting
in May 2023,[105] when it was also confirmed that [Amandla
Stenberg](Amandla_Stenberg "wikilink") would play [Margo Kess /
Spider-Byte](Alternative_versions_of_Spider-Man#Spider-Byte_(Earth-22191) "wikilink").[106]

[Delilah](Delilah_(comics) "wikilink"), a skilled assassin who serves as
the bartender at the Bar with No Name in an [alternate
universe](Multiverse_(Marvel_Comics) "wikilink"), was meant to make an
appearance in the film, but her scene was cut. She would later be
included in the [Insomniac Games](Insomniac_Games "wikilink") video game
*[Spider-Man 2](Spider-Man_2_(2023_video_game) "wikilink")* (2023),
whose [Peter Parker /
Spider-Man](Peter_Parker_(Insomniac_Games_character) "wikilink") appears
in the film.[107]

### Animation and design

Lord revealed that design work for new characters in the film had begun
by November 2019,[108] with comic book artist [Kris
Anka](Kris_Anka "wikilink") later revealing that he was serving as a
character designer on the film.[109][110] On June 9, 2020, the film's
lead animator Nick Kondo announced that production had started.[111] The
different universes visited in the film were designed to look like they
were each drawn by a different artist.[112] Having learned new animation
tools after working on *[The Mitchells vs. the
Machines](The_Mitchells_vs._the_Machines "wikilink")* (2021) following
the first *Spider-Verse* film, Lord and Miller ambitiously employed them
to develop six different animation styles. The intent was to amaze the
audience whenever the characters cross into a new environment so the
film can accurately reflect its plot and the styles can generate various
emotional backdrops.[113] Earth-65, the home of Gwen Stacy, was designed
to look like "impressionistic" [watercolor
paintings](watercolor_painting "wikilink"). The animation team created a
simulator to generate this style and used a visual palette that reflects
Gwen's emotions like a "three dimensional [mood
ring](mood_ring "wikilink")".[114] According to co-director Justin K.
Thompson, the reflection of her emotions through colors is inspired by a
scene in 1950's *[Cinderella](Cinderella_(1950_film) "wikilink")* where
her dress gets torn, and the environment reacts to that trauma. This
style was also intended by Miller to remind the audience about the
covers of the *[Spider-Gwen](Spider-Gwen "wikilink")* comic books. One
of the two alternate Earths seen in the trailer was Earth-50101, which
the crew nicknamed "Mumbattan" after [Mumbai](Mumbai "wikilink") and
[Manhattan](Manhattan "wikilink"), due to that world being based on the
one from [Gotham Entertainment
Group](Gotham_Entertainment_Group "wikilink")'s *[Spider-Man:
India](Spider-Man:_India "wikilink")* comic book series.[115] To give
the character [Pavitr
Prabhakar](Spider-Man_(Pavitr_Prabhakar) "wikilink") unique motion and
fighting style, the creative team researched the 2000-year-old Indian
martial arts, [Kalaripayattu](Kalaripayattu "wikilink"), from the state
of [Kerala](Kerala "wikilink"). The other universe was Nueva York, the
futuristic New York City from the [Marvel 2099](Marvel_2099 "wikilink")
world, was heavily influenced by [Syd Mead](Syd_Mead "wikilink")'s
[neo-futurist](Neo-futurism "wikilink") illustrations, which has an
unfinished look.[116] Also the works of artists [Ron
Cobb](Ron_Cobb "wikilink"), [John
Bell](John_Bell_(special_effects_artist) "wikilink"), [John
Berkey](John_Berkey "wikilink"), [John
Harris](John_Harris_(artist) "wikilink") and [Ralph
McQuarrie](Ralph_McQuarrie "wikilink") were inspirations for the city's
design, in addition to the architecture of [Oscar
Niemeyer](Oscar_Niemeyer "wikilink"). The city was created as a highly
controlled environment reflecting Miguel's personality, and has an
authoritarian, [brutalist](Brutalist_architecture "wikilink") and
minimalist style of design meant to represent a "clean, strong, unified,
front-facing ideology". But when going underground one realizes that
it's a world that can't really be controlled.[117][118]

While the cast and crew were being interviewed for
*[Empire](Empire_(magazine) "wikilink")* in March 2023, codirector
Joaquim Dos Santos revealed that another universe would be "the
[punky](Punk_(subculture) "wikilink") New London, inhabited by Daniel
Kaluuya's Spider-Punk", with a final dimension "being kept tightly under
wraps for now", later revealed to be Earth-42, the world the spider that
bit Miles came from and where he has become that world's version of the
Prowler.[119][120] Spider-Punk's animation style took two to three years
to develop and is inspired by [collage](collage "wikilink") imagery of
1970s punk-rock [album covers](album_cover "wikilink"),
[posters](poster "wikilink"), and [zines](zine "wikilink") emulating the
look of [Xerox](Xerox "wikilink") prints, colored papers and images
appropriated from magazines and newsprints, and has a general grayed-out
quality due to copy machines not having [toner](toner "wikilink") in
them.[121] Also the animators experimented with different frame rates in
order to reflect [DIY](DIY "wikilink") punk visuals and Spider-Punk's
[anarchic](anarchy "wikilink") personality and tendency of
inconsistency. His body is animated on 3s or 2s (8 or 12 images), his
guitar on 4s (6 images), and his outline on 2s or 1s (12 or 24 images);
unlike rest of the characters that are predominantly animated on
2s.[122] In May 2023, Jake Johnson revealed in an interview that a
[Lego](Lego "wikilink") universe would be featured in the film.[123] The
Lego sequence was done by 14-year-old Canadian animator Preston Mutanga
and was added late in the movie, after the filmmakers were so impressed
by his fan-made Lego recreation of the film's first teaser that they
tracked him down and recruited him.[124]

Miles' design was updated for the sequel to show him having gone through
a growth spurt, while Gwen was given a new haircut and an updated
costume. [Rick Leonardi](Rick_Leonardi "wikilink"), the co-creator of
Spider-Man 2099, was brought on to adapt his own designs for the film,
while comic book artist [Brian Stelfreeze](Brian_Stelfreeze "wikilink")
was chosen to shape the visual development of Jess Drew.[125] The Spot's
design, which was influenced by Austrian artist [Egon
Schiele](Egon_Schiele "wikilink"),[126] evolves throughout the film as
he gains more confidence and control of his abilities, beginning with a
style that looks like an "unfinished sketch \[with\] blue construction
lines that evoke a comic book artist's rough drawing before the work
goes to an inker". The Spot's portals were intended to look like "living
ink that had spilled or splattered on the comic artist's drawing", which
created new challenges for the animation team. The Vulture was given a
[Renaissance](Renaissance "wikilink")-era design inspired by the artwork
of [Leonardo da Vinci](Leonardo_da_Vinci "wikilink")'s workbooks.[127]
Thompson also revealed that the design of the spider in the "Go Home
Machine" is influenced by the spider in the movie
*[Krull](Krull_(film) "wikilink")* (1983), which is also named "Ynyr"
after a character from the film.[128] Gwen Stacy's hair received a
redesign in the movie, incorporating [Gwenpool](Gwenpool "wikilink")'s
pink highlights in a reference to *Marvel Rising*. This was credited by
*Across the Spider-Verse* production designer Patrick O'Keefe to artist
Peter Chan in January 2024 as having been based on
[Gurihiru](Gurihiru "wikilink")'s work on *[The Unbelievable
Gwenpool](The_Unbelievable_Gwenpool "wikilink"): [Beyond the Fourth
Wall](Beyond_the_Fourth_Wall "wikilink")*, with the design of Gwen
Stacy's bedroom also taking influence from the color palette of
Gwenpool's hospital gown.[129]

### Post-production

In May 2023, Powers revealed that the film would end on a
[cliffhanger](cliffhanger "wikilink") and co-director Dos Santos
compared it to the *[Star Wars](Star_Wars "wikilink")* [original
trilogy](Star_Wars_original_trilogy "wikilink") film *[The Empire
Strikes Back](The_Empire_Strikes_Back "wikilink")* (1980).[130] Powers
explained:

In the same month, Powers also stated that the film would not be "tied"
to the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](Marvel_Cinematic_Universe "wikilink")
(MCU). In the film, Miguel makes a direct reference to the events of
*[Spider-Man: No Way Home](Spider-Man:_No_Way_Home "wikilink")*, telling
Gwen to not "get \[him\] started on Doctor Strange and that little nerd
back on Earth-199999" — referring to the [Doctor
Strange](Stephen_Strange_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) "wikilink") and
[Spider-Man](Peter_Parker_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) "wikilink") of the
MCU — while attributing the events of *No Way Home* to the collider
explosion from *Into the Spider-Verse*. The quote is meant as a
[throwaway line](throwaway_line "wikilink") that Lord and Miller came up
with.[131] Additionally, [Donald Glover](Donald_Glover "wikilink")
reprises his role as an alternate version of [Aaron Davis /
Prowler](Aaron_Davis_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) "wikilink") from the
MCU film *[Spider-Man: Homecoming](Spider-Man:_Homecoming "wikilink")*
(2017) in a live-action cameo, depicted as a prisoner of the
Spider-Society displaced from his home reality.[132] Production on
*Across the Spider-Verse* was completed on May 20, 2023, 13 days before
the U.S. release date.[133] With a runtime of 140 minutes, it is [the
longest animated film](List_of_longest_animated_films "wikilink") ever
produced by an American studio, surpassing *[Consuming
Spirits](Consuming_Spirits "wikilink")* (2012).[134]

### Allegations of poor working conditions

On June 23, 2023, *[Vulture](Vulture_(website) "wikilink")* reported
that four people who worked on the film alleged that production had
faced difficulties due to numerous requests from Lord for changes to
already finished animation, as well as the need for him to approve
animation layouts early in production.[135][136][137] Lord's directions
were said to take precedence over the decisions of the film's directing
team and led to numerous weeks of long overtime as the animators
drastically revised portions of the film several times. They further
stated that difficult working conditions caused by the constant
revisions caused over 100 artists to leave the project before its
completion, and that both *Into the Spider-Verse* and *The Mitchells vs.
the Machines* (two earlier movies that Lord and Miller co-produced for
Sony) suffered from similar production issues.[138] One artist said that
production on *Beyond the Spider-Verse*, the film's sequel, had not
progressed, and that there was "no way that" it would be completed in
time for its scheduled March 2024 release window. Sony denied the
allegations concerning *Across the Spider-Verse*'s production troubles,
while declining to comment on the possibility of the sequel being
delayed, and producer Amy Pascal called the process of heavy revision
normal.[139][140]

## Music

[Daniel Pemberton](Daniel_Pemberton "wikilink") confirmed in December
2020 that he would return to compose the sequel's score. In December
2022, Lord and Miller confirmed that [Metro
Boomin](Metro_Boomin "wikilink") would create music for its soundtrack.
Several artists were featured on it, including [Coi
Leray](Coi_Leray "wikilink"), [Swae Lee](Swae_Lee "wikilink"),
[Future](Future_(rapper) "wikilink"), [Don
Toliver](Don_Toliver "wikilink"), [James
Blake](James_Blake_(musician) "wikilink"),
[Offset](Offset_(rapper) "wikilink"), [Wizkid](Wizkid "wikilink"), [Lil
Uzi Vert](Lil_Uzi_Vert "wikilink"), [21 Savage](21_Savage "wikilink"),
[Lil Wayne](Lil_Wayne "wikilink"), [Nas](Nas "wikilink"), [ASAP
Rocky](ASAP_Rocky "wikilink"), [Becky G](Becky_G "wikilink"),
[Shenseea](Shenseea "wikilink"), [JID](JID "wikilink"), [A Boogie wit da
Hoodie](A_Boogie_wit_da_Hoodie "wikilink"), and [2
Chainz](2_Chainz "wikilink"). For the Japanese release, an original
song, "Realize" performed by
[Lisa](Lisa_(Japanese_musician,_born_1987) "wikilink"), was featured.
The film was supported by another single, "[Mona
Lisa](Mona_Lisa_(Dominic_Fike_song) "wikilink")" by [Dominic
Fike](Dominic_Fike "wikilink"), released on June 2, 2023—the day of the
film's premiere. Although originally set to be released as a track on
the deluxe edition of the soundtrack album, a few days after its
release, the track was removed. On June 23, 2023, it was announced that
the track was added into some versions of Fike's second studio album
*[Sunburn](Sunburn_(Dominic_Fike_album) "wikilink")*, which was released
on July 7, 2023.

Though external to the film's score and soundtrack, [Daniel
Kaluuya](Daniel_Kaluuya "wikilink") also incorporated musical elements
into his vocal performance as [Spider-Punk / Hobie
Brown](Spider-Punk "wikilink").[141] Kaluuya elaborated that he searched
for the word "Spider-Punk" on [Spotify](Spotify "wikilink"), hoping to
find fan-made playlists. He stated that after finding some he "would
just listen to them, be like vibing out," helping him with the process
of gauging the character's energy.[142] Kaluuya further noted that "he
wanted the character's voice to feel like a song," and that a take in
which he portrayed the character as "rapping, but in a punk style" would
be the one used in the film.[143]

## Marketing

In May 2020, Sony entered into a promotional partnership with [Hyundai
Motor Company](Hyundai_Motor_Company "wikilink") to showcase their new
models and technologies in the film.[144] A
[prologue](prologue "wikilink") for the film was released at [Comic Con
Experience](Comic_Con_Experience "wikilink") in December 2021, revealing
the title and the fact that the film is a two-part sequel.[145]
Following the announcement of the new title and release date in April
2022, Lord and Miller showed 15 minutes of the film (with unfinished
animation) at Sony's [CinemaCon](CinemaCon "wikilink") panel.[146] Lord,
Miller, and the directors showed the same footage at the [Annecy
International Animation Film
Festival](Annecy_International_Animation_Film_Festival "wikilink") in
June, with updated animation and effects.[147] In February 2023, [Funko
Pops](Funko#Product_lines "wikilink") figures based on characters from
the film were revealed.[148] In April 2023, another 14-minute footage
was previewed at Sony's CinemaCon panel.[149] A second trailer was
released on April 4. It gained 148.6M views within 24 hours, becoming
the most-viewed second trailer for a Marvel film within that timespan
and also the most-viewed superhero film trailer of the summer.[150]
*[Rolling Stone](Rolling_Stone "wikilink")*{{'s}} Larisha Paul remarked
that Miles wanted the other heroes to accept and validate him but also
wanted to create his own story and not be controlled by them.[151]
Christian Holub of *[Entertainment
Weekly](Entertainment_Weekly "wikilink")* felt the Spider-People were
more antagonistic and that Miles' family was in more danger than in the
first film.[152] Meanwhile, Abid Rahman from *[The Hollywood
Reporter](The_Hollywood_Reporter "wikilink")* compared Miles'
introduction to the Spider-People in the trailer to the "vibe" of
[Citadel of Ricks](Citadel_of_Ricks "wikilink") and highlighted the
reference to the Spider-Man pointing meme.[153] Commentators also noted
that the trailer posited that Miles could potentially have to choose
between saving the multiverse or his family.[154][155][156]

On May 15, 2023; the film started the sale of different Spider-Verse
themed food items for their collaboration with [Burger
King](Burger_King "wikilink"). The items available during the promotion
included the Spider-Verse [Whopper](Whopper "wikilink") with a red bun
and the Spider-Verse [Sundae](Sundae "wikilink").[157] On May 20, 2023,
[Nike](Nike,_Inc. "wikilink") released a special iteration of the *[Air
Jordan](Air_Jordan "wikilink")* 1 High OG inspired by the film.[158] On
May 23, 2023, [Epic Games](Epic_Games "wikilink") added skins of Miles
Morales and Spider-Man 2099 to *[Fortnite](Fortnite "wikilink")* based
on their designs in the film.[159] The electronics manufacturer
[ZOTAC](ZOTAC "wikilink") also partnered with Sony Pictures to create
limited-edition Spider-Man-themed [RTX
4070](GeForce_40_series "wikilink") graphics cards.[160]

## Release

### Theatrical

*Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse* premiered on May 30, 2023, at the
[Grand Rex](Grand_Rex "wikilink") in Paris, France,[161] and at the
[Regency Village Theater](Regency_Village_Theater "wikilink") in Los
Angeles,[162] and was theatrically released in the United States on June
2, in premium large formats and [IMAX](IMAX "wikilink"). Unlike the
first film, this film was not released in 3D.[163] It was originally set
for release on April 8, 2022,[164] but was shifted to October 7 due to
the [COVID-19 pandemic](COVID-19_pandemic "wikilink").[165] It was then
moved to the June 2023 date.[166] It was the first Sony Pictures
Animation film since *[The Angry Birds Movie
2](The_Angry_Birds_Movie_2 "wikilink")* (2019) to receive a worldwide
theatrical release after a number of the studio's animated films were
assigned direct-to-streaming releases on [Netflix](Netflix "wikilink")
and [Amazon Prime Video](Amazon_Prime_Video "wikilink") in response to
the closure of cinema theaters due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film
was rereleased in IMAX in limited theaters on January 19, 2024,[167]
which marked the debut of a new Columbia Pictures logo that commemorates
the studio's 100th anniversary.[168]

In China, the film premiered in Beijing on May 31, and was released on
June 2.[169] The film's release initially was delayed until June 22,
2023, in the [MENA](MENA "wikilink") region, but later withdrawn from
cinemas across the region due to [the film's transgender
iconography](#Transgender_iconography_and_censorship "wikilink").[170][171][172]

On June 9, 2023, in response to complaints of sound mixing issues from
viewers in some theaters, Sony sent an updated version of the film with
new audio mixing to theaters.[173][174] An official source told
*[Variety](Variety_(magazine) "wikilink")* that, while the issues were
only present at a "handful of theaters", all prints of the film had been
updated and re-sent to cinemas.[175] It was reported that at least two
versions of the film—distinct in slight differences in dialogue and
animations—exist in theaters. For example, in one version, a scene
between Miguel and Lyla ends with Lyla giving a fist bump, while another
ends in Lyla taking a selfie of them. The film's associate editor, Andy
Leviton, confirmed the reports.[176]

### Home media

*Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse* was released on [digital
download](Digital_distribution "wikilink") by [Sony Pictures Home
Entertainment](Sony_Pictures_Home_Entertainment "wikilink") on August 8,
2023, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on September 5.[177] The
digital release of the film featured additional alterations from the
initial theatrical cut, such as the removal of several lines of
dialogue.[178] This version, which was also available in some theaters,
was described by Miller as "an international version" of the film
created to help with the necessary translations needed and to be
approved by the French censorship board. He added that the animators
"cleaned up and tweaked" some of the shots that had already been
submitted for the finished version, with other members of the team, such
as in the sound department, also suggesting alternate ideas, stating,
"Because it's a multiverse movie, it's like there's a multiverse of the
movie – that was really the reasoning behind it. It was trying to make
the best possible version that everyone was going to be the proudest
of." Lord believed some of these changes created an improved film.[179]
Some of the alterations have been controversial with the film's
fanbase.[180]

In April 2021, Sony signed deals with [Netflix](Netflix "wikilink") and
Disney for the rights to their 2022 to 2026 film slate, following the
films' theatrical and home media windows.[181][182] Netflix signed for
exclusive "pay 1 window" streaming rights, which is typically an
18-month window and included the sequels to *Spider-Man: Into the
Spider-Verse*; this deal built on an existing output deal that Netflix
had signed with Sony Pictures Animation in 2014.[183][184] Disney signed
for "pay 2 window" rights for the films, which would be streamed on
[Disney+](Disney+ "wikilink") and [Hulu](Hulu "wikilink") as well as
broadcast on Disney's linear television networks.[185][186]

*Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse* was released on Netflix in the
United States on October 31, 2023.[187]

Brian Tallerico of *[RogerEbert.com](RogerEbert.com "wikilink")* gave
the film 4 out of 4 stars, writing, "Like the work of a young artist who
refuses to be restrained by the borders of the frame, *Across the
Spider-Verse* is loaded with incredible imagery and fascinating ideas.
It is a smart, thrilling piece of work that reminded me of other great
part twos like *[The Dark Knight](The_Dark_Knight "wikilink")* and *[The
Empire Strikes Back](The_Empire_Strikes_Back "wikilink")*."[206] [Ann
Hornaday](Ann_Hornaday "wikilink") of *[The Washington
Post](The_Washington_Post "wikilink")* gave the film 3/4 stars, calling
it "an extravagant, very cool love letter to graphic design, executed
with superb draftsmanship and giddy, infectious joy."[207] [Richard
Roeper](Richard_Roeper "wikilink") of the *[Chicago
Sun-Times](Chicago_Sun-Times "wikilink")* also gave it 3 out of 4 stars,
writing, "It's a bit too much at times, but it's also pretty great, and
it'll be a huge surprise if the third chapter in the trilogy isn't
equally entertaining."[208] [Kevin
Maher](Kevin_Maher_(writer) "wikilink") of *[The
Times](The_Times "wikilink")* gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, writing,
"It rarely draws breath between set pieces, and creates distinct and
spectacular environments for each separate spider-verse."[209]

David Fear of *[Rolling Stone](Rolling_Stone "wikilink")* said that the
film "completely recaptures the panel-to-panel thrill of discovering
your respective era's teen-angsty Marvel icon. The thrill of the
multiversal new is gone. Everything else, however, is extra-webbed for
your pleasure."[210] Alison Willmore of
*[Vulture](Vulture_(website) "wikilink")* wrote, "*Across the
Spider-Verse* looks incredible, even better than the groundbreaking
first installment, but what's truly impressive about it is how willing
it is to entrust its storytelling to its animation."[211] *[The
Atlantic](The_Atlantic "wikilink")*'s David Sims wrote that the film
"avoids seeming like a physics lesson because its visuals are
consistently thrilling; the most static bits of dialogue still pop
because of how daring the animation is."[212]

[Kyle Smith](Kyle_Smith_(critic) "wikilink") of *[The Wall Street
Journal](The_Wall_Street_Journal "wikilink")* described the film as
being "visually hypercaffeinated", but with a slow plot in the first
half of the film, [plotlines](plotline "wikilink") being a "hectic
series of clashes", action sequences that were "jumpy but not especially
engaging", and "too many long monologues".[213] Jake Wilson of *[The
Age](The_Age "wikilink")* gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing,
"Typically for Lord and Miller, the upshot is both adventurous and
conformist, an outwardly bold reimagining of the material that never
stops congratulating us for our brand loyalty, and which plays it safer
in plot terms than the early sequences might lead you to hope."[214]

### Industry response

[Guillermo del Toro](Guillermo_del_Toro "wikilink"), the winner of [2023
Oscar for Best animated
film](Academy_Award_for_Best_Animated_Feature "wikilink"), praised the
film, saying "Spider-Verse will fulfill and heal."[215] During a London
Q&A screening, [Andrew Garfield](Andrew_Garfield "wikilink"), who
portrayed [Peter
Parker](Peter_Parker_(The_Amazing_Spider-Man_film_series) "wikilink") in
[*The Amazing Spider-Man*
films](Spider-Man_in_film#Marc_Webb's_duology "wikilink"), called the
film "a masterpiece of pure cinema".[216] [Bryce Dallas
Howard](Bryce_Dallas_Howard "wikilink"), who played Gwen Stacy in
*[Spider-Man 3](Spider-Man_3 "wikilink")* (2007), expressed her and her
father, [Ron Howard](Ron_Howard "wikilink")'s, love for the movie,
calling it "an astonishing film on every level".[217] The filmmakers
behind *[Kung Fu Panda 4](Kung_Fu_Panda_4 "wikilink")* cited the
*Spider-Verse* films as inspiration for their fight scenes,
incorporating an "inkbrush" style.[218]

#### Transgender iconography and censorship

The film briefly features a [transgender
flag](transgender_flag "wikilink") in two scenes, including on a banner
seen hanging in Gwen Stacy's bedroom with the words "[Protect Trans
Kids](Protect_trans_kids "wikilink")". The flag's appearance led to
speculation that Gwen supports her universe's [transgender rights
movement](transgender_rights_movement "wikilink") or some to interpret
Gwen as being transgender herself.[219][220] Although she is not
identified as transgender in the film, viewers and critics who supported
this interpretation additionally pointed to the use of the flag's colors
(light pink, light blue, and white) elsewhere in scenes involving Gwen
and her universe, and the perceived parallels to [coming
out](coming_out "wikilink") in her character arc within the
film.[221][222] However, others have noted that the blue and white
colors were already used by the [comics' version of Spider-Woman Gwen
Stacy](Spider-Woman_(Gwen_Stacy) "wikilink"), and thus were not
necessarily proof that the film version of the character is trans.[223]
The use of the transgender flag was reported to have led to the film
being withdrawn from release in the [United Arab
Emirates](United_Arab_Emirates "wikilink") and other
[MENA](MENA "wikilink") countries.[224][225]

### TikTok trend

An [Internet meme](Internet_meme "wikilink") involving the notion of
*canon events* began spreading on [TikTok](TikTok "wikilink") after the
film's release,[226][227] which later became a
[trend](Viral_phenomenon "wikilink").[228] The meme's word "canon"
elaborated its special definition as "ironic (if not actually painful)"
experiences in real life.[229] [Collins
Dictionary](Collins_English_Dictionary "wikilink") selected "canon
event" as one of its ten contenders for [Word of the
Year](Word_of_the_year "wikilink") in 2023, defining the term as "an
event that is essential to the formation of an individual's character or
identity."[230]

### Accolades

the Spider-Verse* one of the ten-best films of 2023.[236] It also won
the [National Board of Review Award for Best Animated
Film](National_Board_of_Review_Award_for_Best_Animated_Film "wikilink").[237]

Spider-Verse* as the second greatest animated film of the 21st
century.[238]

## Future

### Sequel

A third film was confirmed when Lord and Miller revealed in December
2021 that *Across* *the Spider-Verse* was being split into two films.
*Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part Two)* was expected at that
point to be released in 2023.[239] In April 2022, it was retitled
*Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.*[240][241] In response to a claim
by an artist on *Across the Spider-Verse*, who spoke to *Vulture* on
condition of anonymity, that it would not be possible to release *Beyond
the Spider-Verse* as scheduled (which at the time was on March 29, 2024)
due to an alleged lack of production progress,[242] Lord and Miller
stated that the production would "take the time necessary" for the film
to be completed to their standards.[243] In July 2023, the film was
removed from the release schedule, reportedly due to the [2023 SAG-AFTRA
strike](2023_SAG-AFTRA_strike "wikilink"), and its original release date
was taken by *[Ghostbusters: Frozen
Empire](Ghostbusters:_Frozen_Empire "wikilink")*, as a source within
Sony—a member of the
[AMPTP](Alliance_of_Motion_Picture_and_Television_Producers "wikilink")
against whom [SAG-AFTRA](SAG-AFTRA "wikilink") was negotiating—told
*Variety* that the strike precluded the film's voice cast from recording
their lines on schedule.[244] Following the conclusion of the strike in
November 2023, *[Deadline Hollywood](Deadline_Hollywood "wikilink")*
reported that the voice recording for the film was set to resume that
same month.[245] Production was confirmed to have resumed in
December.[246]

### Spin-off

Sony began developing a *Spider-Women* film in November 2018 that would
focus on three generations of female, Spider-related characters. Bek
Smith was writing the spin-off,[247] and [Lauren
Montgomery](Lauren_Montgomery "wikilink") was in talks to direct.[248]
Pascal said the film would focus on the characters Gwen Stacy /
Spider-Gwen, [Cindy Moon / Silk](Silk_(character) "wikilink"), and Jess
Drew / Spider-Woman, and said *Across the Spider-Verse* would serve as a
"launching pad" for it.[249] In May 2023, producer [Avi
Arad](Avi_Arad "wikilink") stated that the film would be titled
*Spider-Woman*.[250]

### Manga spin-off

On May 29, 2023, it was announced that a manga spin-off titled
*Spider-Man: Octopus Girl* written by Hideyuki Furuhashi and illustrated
by Betten Court would begin serialization on June 20 on
[Shueisha](Shueisha "wikilink")'s *[Shōnen
Jump+](Shōnen_Jump+ "wikilink")* website and app. The story revolves
around [Doctor Octopus](Doctor_Octopus "wikilink"), who falls into a
coma and has been reawakened in the body of young Japanese middle
schooler named Otoha Okutamiya.[251][252] In February 2024, [Viz
Media](Viz_Media "wikilink") announced that they licensed the series for
English publication in the fourth quarter of 2024.[253]
