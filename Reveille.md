# Reveille (dog)

**Reveille** is the official [mascot](mascot "wikilink") of [Texas A&M
University](Texas_A&M_University "wikilink"). Students adopted the first
Reveille, a [mixed-breed dog](mixed-breed_dog "wikilink"), in 1931. The
cadets raised $100 during World War II to make Reveille a general, as
part of a fundraiser for the K-9 Corps. Reveille is the
highest-ranking member of the [Texas A&M Corps of
Cadets](Texas_A&M_Corps_of_Cadets "wikilink").

Eight years after the first Reveille died, a graduate of the university
donated a [Shetland Sheepdog](Shetland_Sheepdog "wikilink") to be the
second official Aggie mascot, Reveille II. The third Reveille was the
first to be a purebred [Rough Collie](Rough_Collie "wikilink"); all
subsequent mascots have belonged to this breed. Reveille IV, V, VI, VII,
and VIII died in 1989, 1999, 2003, 2013, and 2018, respectively.
Reveille IX served from May 9, 2015, until her retirement on April 30,
2021. She now resides at the Stevenson Companion Animal Life-Care Center
on campus. The current mascot, Reveille X, assumed her role as mascot on
April 30, 2021, during the Corps of Cadets Final Review. All Reveilles
to date have been female.

When they die, the Reveilles are buried in a special cemetery located
outside the north end of [Kyle Field](Kyle_Field "wikilink"). The bodies
are laid facing the south end zone and the scoreboard. After the
addition to Kyle Field was built at the north end, blocking the view of
the scoreboard, a small scoreboard was placed outside the stadium, named
the Reveille Scoreboard, so the tradition could live on.

## Reveille I

In January 1931, several members of
the [Fightin' Texas Aggie Band](Fightin'_Texas_Aggie_Band "wikilink")
were returning from a party in nearby [Navasota,
Texas](Navasota,_Texas "wikilink"), when they unexpectedly hit a small
black and white stray mutt. They brought the dog with them, and smuggled
her into Legett Hall, fully intending to take her to the vet school
the next day. The next morning, her presence was made apparent when
"[Reveille](Reveille "wikilink")" was blown by a bugler and the dog
began barking, hence Reveille became her name. Although it was
against the rules to keep pets in the dorms, the cadets fell in love
with the dog and kept her anyway.

During the opening of football season, Reveille was named official
mascot when she led the band onto [Kyle Field](Kyle_Field "wikilink")
for a half-time performance. She would wear a jacket with A&M colors and
pace the sidelines during games.

Due to the quantity of officers and soldiers Texas A&M contributed to
the [US Armed Forces](US_Armed_Forces "wikilink") in [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink"), Reveille was given the honorary title of
Cadet General by the U.S. Army. Since that time, Reveille has worn the
rank of Cadet General (5 diamonds). Since 5 diamonds are not
manufactured, cadets align Cadet Lieutenant Colonel and Cadet Colonel
rank on her uniform.

Upon her death on January 18, 1944, she received a formal military
funeral on the fifty-yard line in Kyle Field and then was buried at the
north entrance facing the scoreboard so that she can always watch the
Aggies play.

## Reveille II

**Reveille II** (ca. 1952 – August 23, 1966) Reveille II was the second
official Aggie mascot. Eight years after the first Reveille died, the
student body attempted to raise money to purchase a new mascot. After
they failed to raise enough, Arthur Weinert, a graduate of the Class of
1900, donated a [Shetland Sheepdog](Shetland_Sheepdog "wikilink") to the
students in 1952. Named Reveille II, the new unofficial mascot was cared
for by the [Fightin' Texas Aggie
Band](Fightin'_Texas_Aggie_Band "wikilink") from 1952 to 1954. During
the summer of 1954, a student found Reveille II wandering loose around
campus. He and a classmate cared for her and then took her home with
them for the rest of the summer. During the fall semester, she lived
with one of the students, Sam Netterville, in his dorm room.

The university at the time refused to pay for the mascot's care.
Netterville convinced the student senate to pass a resolution stating
that Reveille's care would be provided by his unit, A Quartermaster
Company. The unit asked fellow students to donate money towards her but
took responsibility for her daily needs.

Netterville took Reveille with him everywhere, including classes, thus
launching the tradition of the mascot being escorted at all times. "Miss
Rev," as they called her, marched with the Aggie Band at football games,
but had a habit of [relieving herself](urination "wikilink") on the
football field. Students often placed bets as to which yard line she
would choose.

Reveille II died in 1966 of kidney failure and arthritis.

## Reveille III

**Reveille III** (died May 31, 1975) Reveille III was the first of the
Texas A&M mascots to be a pure-bred Rough Collie. She served as mascot
from 1966 through 1975.

## Reveille IV

**Reveille IV** (died March 29, 1989) Reveille IV served as Texas A&M
mascot from 1975–1984. Over 10,000 mourners attended her funeral on
April 9. She was donated by veterinarian Tom Godwin of Deer Park,
Texas, a member of the class of 1967.

## Reveille V

**Reveille V** (August 29, 1984 – June 25, 1999) Reveille V was a
descendant of a championship purebred Rough Collie. She was chosen to be
mascot from a pool of 2000 puppies because of her lineage and her
marking. In December 1984, Reveille V was brought to the Texas A&M
campus, and her first official appearance as mascot came at a basketball
game on January 11, 1985. During her tenure, she attended every Texas
A&M football game with one exception. During the 1987 corps trip, TCU
officials refused to allow the Aggie mascot into the TCU stadium citing
a regulation disallowing live mascots at home games. She attended many
home basketball, baseball and volleyball games. A mischievous dog,
Reveille V often stole erasers from chalkboards during class.

In early November 1993, Reveille V underwent emergency surgery for
[gastric volvulus](gastric_volvulus "wikilink"), which causes an
animal's stomach to twist out of place. The surgery was successful, and
she made a full recovery. Later that month she relinquished her spot
as mascot to Reveille VI. For the next six years she lived with a
local veterinarian and graduate of Texas A&M, Joe West. Reveille V was
euthanized in June 1999 because she suffered from arthritis and a
neurological disorder. Her funeral was delayed until September to enable
students to attend. Over 3,000 students and alumni attended the
funeral, which included "[Taps](Taps_(bugle_call) "wikilink")", a
prayer from a campus chaplain, and eulogies from her former handlers.
Reveille V was initially buried at Cain Park on the Texas A&M campus,
but her grave was relocated to the north end of [Kyle
Field](Kyle_Field "wikilink") once stadium renovations were
finished.

## Reveille VI

**Reveille VI** (September 3, 1993 – October 18, 2003) Reveille VI was a
registered Rough Collie born in [Woodward,
Oklahoma](Woodward,_Oklahoma "wikilink"), and took over as Texas A&M's
mascot from Reveille V during halftime of the football game against the
[University of Louisville](Louisville_Cardinals_football "wikilink") on
November 13, 1993. Upon induction into the Aggie family, she quickly
assumed the roles and duties of her predecessor and began attending
university functions including football games.

Shortly after beginning her duties, Reveille was kidnapped by a group of
[University of Texas](University_of_Texas "wikilink") students led by
Neil Andrew Sheffield. For almost a week, Texas A&M denied that the
mascot had been stolen. After the school finally acknowledged her
disappearance and released a statement that they were planning to press
felony charges against whoever took her, Reveille was tied to a sign
post near [Lake Travis](Lake_Travis "wikilink") and an anonymous caller
informed the police of her location. She was returned unharmed to Texas
A&M and resumed her duties. Reveille VI became a movie star in the 1996
film *Reveille, My Life as the Aggie Mascot*. She was in attendance with
the Aggie football team during their first Big 12 Championship in 1998,
and celebrated alongside President [George W.
Bush](George_W._Bush "wikilink") at the inaugural ball in [Washington,
D.C.](Washington,_D.C. "wikilink"), in 2001.

In 1996, she was diagnosed with idiopathic
[epilepsy](epilepsy "wikilink") and later
[arthritis](arthritis "wikilink"). Although for the next four years she
was able to resist her ailments and continue with her duties as mascot,
these health problems would eventually lead to her early retirement in
May 2001.

She was retired on May 12, 2001, into the care of Charlie Hall, who
served as the veterinarian for Reveilles IV, V and VI. She
celebrated her 10th birthday on September 3, 2003, at a party hosted by
Hall and his wife, Diana. Reveille VI was in declining health and was
said to be taking nine different pills and two forms of liquid
medications each day to help combat seizures and other problems.

Six weeks later, on October 18, 2003, Reveille VI was
[euthanized](animal_euthanasia "wikilink"). The decision was made by
Hall and other Texas A&M veterinarians because of her deteriorating
health. Funeral services were held Sunday, November 2, 2003, at [Kyle
Field](Kyle_Field "wikilink"). Speakers at her funeral were former
mascot corporals Mark Boynton, Class of 1997, and Jeff Bailey, Class of
2000. Following the funeral service, Reveille VI was buried among
earlier Reveilles at the north entrance to Kyle Field.

## Reveille VII

**Reveille VII** (October 9, 2000 – May 30, 2013) Reveille VII was a
registered Rough Collie born in Argent Kennel, which is part of the
Animal Hospital of [Ft.
Lauderdale](Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida "wikilink"). She was donated to
Texas A&M by Cindi Bossart, [VMD](Veterinary_Medical_Doctor "wikilink"),
her husband Jim Efron and breeder Nancy MacDonald. Reveille arrived on
campus on February 16, 2001, and officially took over duties from
Reveille VI at the Corps of Cadets [Final
Review](Traditions_of_Texas_A&M_University#Final_Review "wikilink") on
May 12, 2001.

At a pre-game performance at the Texas
A&M-[TCU](TCU_Horned_Frogs_football "wikilink") game in December,
Reveille's nervous, high-pitched barks could be heard above the band. It
was decided by administrators and the Corps of Cadets that she be sent
to obedience school. She worked closely with her professional trainer,
Kay Stephens, and her newly appointed mascot corporal throughout the
summer for her return for football season. Despite several stints in
obedience school, Reveille's manners at times needed work. Though other
incidents have been suspected, in 2007, it was reported that Reveille
VII bit her handler after having her tail stepped on during a morning
run. On February 13, 2008, her impending retirement at the end of
the school year was announced at a news conference at the Corps
Center. In the summer of 2008, she began her retirement at the
age of 7 living with two other dogs under the care of Paul and Tina
Gardner in [Wellborn, Texas](Wellborn,_Texas "wikilink").

Texas A&M University president [R. Bowen
Loftin](R._Bowen_Loftin "wikilink") reported via Twitter that Reveille
VII died on May 30, 2013, at home in Aggieland.

## Reveille VIII

**Reveille VIII** (died June 25, 2018) assumed her duties as the
official mascot of Texas A&M University in August 2008, just before the
fall semester, following the retirement of her predecessor at the
conclusion of the spring semester. She was introduced formally at the
August 31, 2008, season-opening football game at [Kyle
Field](Kyle_Field "wikilink").

A May 1, 2008, memo released by Dean L. Bresciani revealed some of the
features of the new dog. She would be a mature female, meaning she would
be at least a year and a half old. The special committee assigned to
look for Reveille VIII looked for a mascot that would be medium to large
size, healthy, have an upbeat personality, be at ease around crowds and
like people, be able to be calm around loud noises, and be positively
motivated, as well as not highly reactive. Perhaps most importantly, to
prevent the behavioral problems seen in Reveille VII, “professional
training protocols and oversight \[are to\] be established, implemented,
and periodically evaluated, \[and will include\] a transition period to
help Reveille successfully acclimate to and carry out her role as the
mascot of Texas A&M University.”

On August 11, 2008, Texas A&M University announced the selection of
Reveille VIII, a two-year-old female Rough Collie, formerly named Kelly.
She was donated by the Rough Collie breeders Julie Hinrichsen and
Russell Dyke, owners of Juell Collies in [Topeka,
Kansas](Topeka,_Kansas "wikilink"). In compensation for the
new mascot, Texas A&M Corps of Cadets donated $5000 in private donations
to the *Collie Club of America* and the former owners donated $1000.

In September 2014, it was announced that Reveille VIII would retire at
the end of spring semester and once a successor was found. She was then
moved to Stevenson Companion Animal Life Care Center on the campus of
Texas A&M.

Reveille VIII died June 25, 2018.

## Reveille IX

**Reveille IX** (born November 22, 2013) was officially announced by
Texas A&M University on Tuesday, March 10, 2015, and assumed her role on
May 9, 2015. Reveille IX was donated by Overland Collies, based in
Chagrin Falls, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb. The establishment's owners,
Marcy and Mike Fine, are typically well represented among finalists at
the annual Collie Nationals. Reveille IX maintained a Twitter
following where she tweeted about 'her Aggies.' On February 5, 2021,
Texas A&M announced that Reveille IX would be retiring in May 2021.
On April 30, 2021, Reveille IX officially retired and now resides on
campus at the Stevenson Companion Animal Life-Care Center.

## Reveille X

**Reveille X** (born September 5, 2019) officially assumed Mascot duties
on April 30, 2021.  She was donated by the Rough Collie breeders
Julie Hinrichsen and Russell Dyke, the same breeders who donated
Reveille VIII.

## Daily life

Reveille is officially cared for by Corps of Cadets Company E-2, known
as the "mascot company", and the 1959 successor to A Quartermaster Co. A
sophomore in the unit is designated the "mascot corporal" and has
ultimate responsibility for her care. Reveille accompanies the mascot
corporal everywhere, including to class and on dates.

Reveille is considered a cadet general and the highest-ranking member in
the Corps of Cadets. To designate her rank, Reveille wears five diamonds
on her maroon-and-white blanket. Freshmen cadets are required to
address her as "Miss Rev, ma'am." Reveille is the only canine on
campus, other than service animals, that is permitted to enter any
campus building. It is a widely held tradition that if Reveille
decides to sleep on a cadet's bed, that cadet is required to sleep on
the floor. However, in reality, she is constantly under the care of her
handler and is not permitted to freely roam the dormitory or campus.
This tradition likely applied only to the first Reveille. By
tradition, if she barks in class, that session is cancelled.
Reveille has her own cell phone, operated by the mascot corporal, and
her own student identification card.

## Cemetery

Texas A&M maintains a cemetery on campus where all of the past Reveilles
are buried. Reveilles I through IV were buried side by side in a small
cemetery in front of [Kyle Field](Kyle_Field "wikilink") with their
noses and paws pointed so that they could look through the north tunnel
and see the stadium scoreboard. This way, "they can always watch the
Aggies outscore their opponent on the field."

In 1997, the university decided to expand Kyle Field and build the
Bernard C. Richardson Zone at the north end of the stadium. This
necessitated the removal of the cemetery. After meeting with
representatives of the Traditions Council, Student Senate, and E-2, the
athletic department decided to create a temporary cemetery across the
street in Cain Park. Upon completion of the stadium addition in 1999,
the graves were relocated to a permanent cemetery at the new, tree-lined
Richardson Zone Plaza. Since the recent additions blocked the
gravesites' view of Kyle Field, a miniature scoreboard was constructed
on the outside of the stadium so that the deceased mascots can still
watch the Aggies play.
