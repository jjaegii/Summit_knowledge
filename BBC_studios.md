# BBC Studios

**BBC Studios Limited** is a British content company. It is a commercial
subsidiary of the [BBC](BBC "wikilink") that was formed in April 2018
through the merger of the BBC's commercial production arm and the BBC's
commercial international distribution arm, [BBC
Worldwide](BBC_Worldwide "wikilink"). BBC Studios creates, develops,
produces, distributes, broadcasts, finances and sells content around the
world, returning around £200 million to the BBC annually in dividends 
and content investment.

## Overview

[BBC Studios Productions](BBC_Studios_Productions "wikilink") brings
together the majority of [BBC Television](BBC_Television "wikilink")'s
former in-house production departments; Factual, Drama, Comedy (both
combined as Scripted in the new division), Entertainment, and Music &
Events. BBC Children's production is set to move into BBC Studios
Productions from April 2022 to increase the potential of taking British
children's content to the wider global market, along with [BBC
Three](BBC_Three "wikilink")'s in-house production team, which is
joining from April 2021.

[BBC News](BBC_News "wikilink") and [BBC Radio](BBC_Radio "wikilink")
remain separate internal production divisions in the BBC, and the rest
of the former BBC Television division (channels and genre commissioning,
including [BBC Sport](BBC_Sport "wikilink") and [BBC
iPlayer](BBC_iPlayer "wikilink")) are part of the BBC Content division.

The BBC Studios production division was formed in 2016 and launched as a
commercial entity in 2017, enabling it to produce programming for
other broadcasters and services to generate profit to return to the BBC
to supplement [licence
fee](Television_licensing_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") income. In
exchange, the BBC agreed to place production of much of its non-news
programmes [to tender](Request_for_tender "wikilink"), allowing
third-party independents to compete with BBC Studios on bids to produce
them.

The merger of BBC Studios and BBC Worldwide in 2018, brought the company
in line with other major multinational studio conglomerates.

BBC Studios Productions was the UK's most commissioned creator of new
content in 2019, with 77 new commissions from the BBC and third-parties.
It achieved 73 awards and 202 nominations in 2019/2020.

BBC Studios represents formats and programmes made by hundreds of
independent producers, as well as its own production teams and returned
£176m to the independent sector in 2018/2019.

The company is on track to meet its five-year target of returning £1.2bn
to the BBC by 2021/2022. BBC Studios has committed to growing this
total by a further 30% to a new target of £1.5bn in the five years from
2022/2023.

## History

BBC Studios Ltd. as a production company was first registered on 27
February 2015. In September 2015, the BBC's general director [Tony
Hall](Tony_Hall,_Baron_Hall_of_Birkenhead "wikilink") announced a
proposal to split the BBC's in-house production units for non-news
television programming into a separate BBC Studios division, which would
eventually, with [BBC Trust](BBC_Trust "wikilink") approval as part of
the next revision to the BBC's charter, be spun-out as a for-profit
subsidiary of the BBC. This proposal would allow the BBC's units to
produce programmes for other broadcasters and digital outlets (which
could be done in conjunction with its international distribution arm
[BBC Worldwide](BBC_Worldwide "wikilink")) in addition to the BBC's
publicly funded properties. As a for-profit company, BBC Studios would
be allowed to pay higher wages to its executives and talent, and no
longer face scrutiny over them as it did as a public entity. The
proposal was described by *[The Guardian](The_Guardian "wikilink")* as
being "one of the biggest changes to the BBC in its 93-year
history".

The proposal attracted criticism from independent studios, who felt that
it would result in the formation of a "super-indie" that would unduly
benefit from "guaranteed" programme commissions from the BBC. As part of
the split, the BBC planned to [tender](Request_for_tender "wikilink")
its programmes, so that independent producers and BBC Studios could bid
for the rights to produce its non-news programming, outside of top shows
(such as *[Doctor Who](Doctor_Who "wikilink")*) assigned to BBC
Studios. The re-organisation and formation of BBC Studios as a
division of the BBC was completed in April 2016. In September 2016,
the BBC announced that it would tender its non-news programmes over the
next 11 years, beginning with programmes such as *[A Question of
Sport](A_Question_of_Sport "wikilink")*, *[Holby
City](Holby_City "wikilink")* and *[Songs of
Praise](Songs_of_Praise "wikilink")*.

In October 2016, the BBC announced that it planned to lay off 300
employees from the division seen as redundant. In December 2016, BBC
Studios announced that it had reached an agreement with [Producers
Alliance for Cinema and
Television](Producers_Alliance_for_Cinema_and_Television "wikilink")
(PACT) in regards to the tendering plan, stating that it would tender at
least 40% of the "in-house guarantee" within two years of approval of
the transition. The [BBC Trust](BBC_Trust "wikilink") subsequently
approved the creation of BBC Studios as a commercial subsidiary, with
the process expected to be completed in April 2017.

On 29 November 2017, the BBC announced that BBC Worldwide would be
merged into BBC Studios effective 1 April 2018. The BBC stated that by
handling both the production and sales of its programming within one
unit, it would improve efficiency and be in line with the "global norms"
of other major international media companies. Technically, BBC
Ventures Group Ltd. was renamed BBC Studios Group Ltd. on 3 April 2018,
and then BBC Studios Ltd. 1 October 2018; also in October, the
production company established in 2015 was renamed BBC Studios
Productions Ltd., and so did [BBC Worldwide
Ltd.](BBC_Worldwide "wikilink"), which was renamed BBC Studios
Distribution Ltd.

In April 2019, BBC Studios announced various agreements with [Discovery,
Inc.](Discovery,_Inc. "wikilink"); the companies agreed to break apart
their [UKTV](UKTV "wikilink") joint venture, with Discovery (which had
acquired a stake in UKTV after its purchase of [Scripps Networks
Interactive](Scripps_Networks_Interactive "wikilink")) acquiring the
BBC's stake in UKTV's lifestyle channels, and BBC Studios likewise
acquiring Discovery's stakes in UKTV's entertainment channels and the
video on-demand service [UKTV Play](UKTV_Play "wikilink"). In addition,
Discovery announced a 10-year agreement with the BBC's [Natural History
Unit](BBC_Studios_Natural_History_Unit "wikilink") to acquire exclusive
subscription video-on-demand rights to its content worldwide (which
would be incorporated into a forthcoming [global streaming
brand](Discovery+ "wikilink")), and co-fund a development team.
Discovery had previously served as the Natural History's Unit U.S.
partner until 2013.

In August 2019, BBC Studios announced a long-term deal with
[WarnerMedia](WarnerMedia "wikilink")'s upcoming [HBO
Max](HBO_Max "wikilink") for streaming rights to past seasons of top BBC
programmes such as *Doctor Who*, *[The Honourable
Woman](The_Honourable_Woman "wikilink")*,
*[Luther](Luther_(TV_series) "wikilink")*, and *[Top
Gear](Top_Gear_(2002_TV_series) "wikilink")*. In January 2020, it
also sold second-window streaming rights to 14 series to [CW
Seed](CW_Seed "wikilink") (a video on-demand platform operated by [The
CW](The_CW "wikilink"), a television network co-owned by
WarnerMedia).

In February 2021, BBC Studios launched a new streaming brand in North
America known as [BBC
Select](BBC_Select_(streaming_service) "wikilink"), dedicated to factual
content. On 22 February 2021, BBC Studios signed a first-look deal
with Gobstopper Group.

In March 2021, it was announced that the BBC Children's Productions and
BBC Global News units would also be transferred into BBC Studios. With
the change, BBC Studios will handle international distribution and
advertising sales for [BBC World News](BBC_World_News "wikilink"), while
the public service BBC News operation will assume editorial control of
the channel. More recently, the studio had set up a development
deal with EbonyLife Media, which was affiliated with [Sony Pictures
Television](Sony_Pictures_Television "wikilink"), headed by [Mo
Abudu](Mo_Abudu "wikilink").

In August 2022, it was revealed that BBC Studios planned to launch an
international newsletter business, initially focusing on Canada and the
US, the BBC's second largest non-UK news market behind India.

In June 2023, BBC Studios announced the acquisition of Scandinavian
production company STV (not to be confused with Scotland's [STV
Group](STV_Group "wikilink")). The Copenhagen-based company will be
rebranded BBC Studios Nordic Productions.

In October 2023, press reports confirmed that BBC Studios had reached a
multi-million pound financial settlement to compensate Top Gear
presenter [Freddie Flintoff](Andrew_Flintoff "wikilink") for the
injuries he sustained in a car crash when filming a Top Gear episode in
December 2022.

## BBC Records

**BBC Records** was a division of the [BBC](BBC "wikilink") founded in
1967 to commercially exploit the corporation's output for radio and
television for both educational and domestic use. In the 1990s
licensing and marketing of the BBC's recorded output become the
responsibility of **[BBC Worldwide](BBC_Worldwide "wikilink") (formerly
BBC Enterprises)**, and the corporation ceased the direct release of
recorded material, instead licensing its products to other companies.
BBC Worldwide was merged into BBC Studios from 2018, which now licenses
the use of the BBC logo on commercial recordings.

## BritBox

**BritBox** is an [over-the-top](Over-the-top_media_service "wikilink")
[subscription video
on-demand](video_on_demand#Subscription_models "wikilink") brand, which
includes original programming commissioned or acquired by the company,
and third-party content licensed from other UK channels such as
[BBC](BBC "wikilink"), [ITV](ITV_plc "wikilink"), [Channel
4](Channel_4 "wikilink") and [Channel
5](Channel_5_(British_TV_channel) "wikilink"). The service was announced
by [BBC Worldwide](BBC_Worldwide "wikilink") and [ITV
plc](ITV_plc "wikilink") as a joint venture in 2016 and launched in 2017
in North America; the international service remains a joint
venture of BBC Studios and ITV plc.

A separately managed UK version of the service launched in 2019 but is
now a fully owned subsidiary of ITV, after they announced in 2022 that
they had bought out the BBC and its other partners with the intention of
integrating the service with [ITVX](ITVX "wikilink").
