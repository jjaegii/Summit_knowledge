# Figure-eight knot

The **figure-eight knot** or **figure-of-eight knot** is a
type of [stopper knot](stopper_knot "wikilink"). It is very important in
both [sailing](sailing "wikilink") and [rock
climbing](rock_climbing "wikilink") as a method of stopping ropes from
running out of retaining devices. Like the [overhand
knot](overhand_knot "wikilink"), which will jam under strain, often
requiring the rope to be cut, the figure-eight will also jam, but is
usually more easily undone than the overhand knot.

The [stevedore knot](stevedore_knot "wikilink") is the figure-eight knot
with two half twists added before the end is finally stuck.

## Different types

### Figure-eight loop

The **figure-eight loop** is used like an [overhand
loop](overhand_loop "wikilink") knot. This type of knot can be used in
[prusik](prusik "wikilink") climbing when used in conjunction with a
[climbing harness](climbing_harness "wikilink"), a climbing rope, and
locking [carabiner](carabiner "wikilink") designed for climbing, to
ascend or descend with minimal equipment and effort.

### Figure-eight bend

The **figure-eight bend knot** is used to
"[splice](Rope_splicing "wikilink")" together two ropes, not necessarily
of equal diameter. This knot is tied starting with a loose figure-eight
knot on one rope (the larger-diameter one if unequal), and threading of
the other rope's running end through the first figure eight, starting at
the first figure-eight's running end and paralleling the path of the
first rope through the figure eight until the second's ropes running end
lies parallel against first's standing end. The result is two
figure-eight knots, each partly inside the other and tightening its hold
on the other when they are pulled in opposite directions. This can be a
permanent or temporary splice. While it precludes the ropes' slipping
relative to each other, it is a typical knot in having less strength
than the straight ropes.

### Offset figure-eight bend

The **offset figure-eight bend** is a poor knot that has been implicated
in the deaths of several rock climbers.

### Stein knot

The **stein knot** (also known as a **stone knot**) is a variation of
the figure-eight knot. It is used to secure a rope that is already
passed around a post or through a ring. It is quick and easy to tie and
untie. It is a device rigging rather than a true knot. In
[canyoneering](canyoneering "wikilink"), it is used to isolate rope
strands to allow one person to [rappel](Abseiling "wikilink") while
another is getting on the rappel, or allow rappellers the option of
using a single or a double rope. It is also used in
[basketmaking](basketmaking "wikilink").

## Symbolic use

-   In [heraldry](heraldry "wikilink"), this knot is known as [Savoy
    knot](Savoy_knot "wikilink").
-   In the [United States Navy](United_States_Navy "wikilink"), a
    figure-of-eight badge was formerly worn by enlisted men who had
    successfully completed the apprentice rating.
-   In [The Scout Association](The_Scout_Association "wikilink") in the
    United Kingdom, awards for gallantry and long service are
    represented by a cloth figure-of-eight knot emblem in various
    colours.
