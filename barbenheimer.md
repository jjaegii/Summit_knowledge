# Barbenheimer

**Barbenheimer** was a [cultural](Culture "wikilink")
[phenomenon](phenomenon "wikilink") which preceded and surrounded the
simultaneous [theatrical release](theatrical_release "wikilink") of two
films, [Warner Bros. Pictures](Warner_Bros._Pictures "wikilink")'
*[Barbie](Barbie_(film) "wikilink")* and [Universal
Pictures](Universal_Pictures "wikilink")'
*[Oppenheimer](Oppenheimer_(film) "wikilink")*, on July 21, 2023. The
word is a [portmanteau](Blend_word "wikilink") of the films' titles. The
strong contrast between *Barbie*—a [fantasy
comedy](fantasy_comedy "wikilink") by [Greta
Gerwig](Greta_Gerwig "wikilink") about the fashion doll
[Barbie](Barbie "wikilink")—and *Oppenheimer*—an
[epic](Epic_film "wikilink")
[biographical](Biographical_film "wikilink")
[thriller](Thriller_film "wikilink") by [Christopher
Nolan](Christopher_Nolan "wikilink") about physicist [J. Robert
Oppenheimer](J._Robert_Oppenheimer "wikilink"), scientific director of
the [Manhattan Project](Manhattan_Project "wikilink")—prompted a comedic
response from Internet users, including
[memes](Internet_meme "wikilink"), merchandise and memorabilia.
*[Polygon](Polygon_(website) "wikilink")* described the two films as
"extreme opposites", and *[Variety](Variety_(magazine) "wikilink")*
called the phenomenon "the movie event of the year".

The simultaneous release was an instance of
[counterprogramming](counterprogramming_(film_distribution) "wikilink").
As the release date approached, discussion centered on the appositeness
of watching the films as a [double feature](double_feature "wikilink"),
as well as in what order to watch them, instead of generating a rivalry.
Cast members of both responded by encouraging audiences to watch the
films on the same day. Celebrity participants included actor [Tom
Cruise](Tom_Cruise "wikilink"), who purchased tickets to watch both
while his latest film, *[Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part
One](Mission:_Impossible_–_Dead_Reckoning_Part_One "wikilink")*, was
still playing in theaters. While the phenomenon began as a joke about
the two films' seemingly endless differences, some media commentators
have pointed out similarities; both films have been analyzed as
exploring [existentialism](existentialism "wikilink") and the
theoretical notion of the [Anthropocene](Anthropocene "wikilink"), each
has an [Academy Award](Academy_Award "wikilink")-nominated director and
screenwriter and a large [ensemble cast](ensemble_cast "wikilink"), and
both were produced by a husband-and-wife [production
company](production_company "wikilink").

Both *Barbie* and *Oppenheimer* received critical acclaim and exceeded
box-office expectations. Their joint opening weekend was the
fourth-largest at the American box office, and both rank among the
[highest-grossing films of
2023](2023_in_film#Highest-grossing_films "wikilink"). The phenomenon
also extended to the year's awards season, in which both films emerged
as leading contenders. The films earned a combined 21 nominations at the
[96th Academy Awards](96th_Academy_Awards "wikilink"). Both films were
nominated for the [Academy Award for Best
Picture](Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture "wikilink"), which *Oppenheimer* 
won.

## History

### Release date dispute

In December 2020, citing the [impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
cinema](impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_cinema "wikilink"),
[WarnerMedia](WarnerMedia "wikilink"), the then-[parent
company](parent_company "wikilink") of [Warner Bros.
Pictures](Warner_Bros._Pictures "wikilink"), announced it would release
all 17 of its upcoming 2021 films exclusively on its streaming service,
[HBO Max](Max_(streaming_service) "wikilink"), in what was nicknamed
"Project Popcorn". This decision was heavily criticized the same month
by director [Christopher Nolan](Christopher_Nolan "wikilink"), whose
films had been distributed by Warner Bros. since 2002's
*[Insomnia](Insomnia_(2002_film) "wikilink")*. In a statement to *[The
Hollywood Reporter](The_Hollywood_Reporter "wikilink")*, Nolan said,
"Some of our industry's biggest filmmakers and most important movie
stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the
greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the
worst streaming service." He also said that Warner Bros. "\[doesn't\]
even understand what they're losing", and that the "decision \[made\] no
economic sense". Warner Bros. eventually backed off from the
streaming-exclusive releasing plan for their feature films in March
2021.

Nevertheless, after Warner Bros.' initial plan, Nolan met with several
rival studios, and announced in September 2021 that his next film,
*[Oppenheimer](Oppenheimer_(film) "wikilink")*, would be distributed by
[Universal Pictures](Universal_Pictures "wikilink") instead of
Warner. Conditions for making his next film with Universal included:
a budget of $100 million, a marketing budget of equal size, creative
control, 20% of first-dollar gross, a blackout period whereby the studio
would not release another movie three weeks before or after release and,
to ensure it would not land on a streaming service immediately, a
100-day theatrical window. The following month, Universal announced
the July 21, 2023, release date for *Oppenheimer*. Warner Bros.
had originally scheduled the [Looney
Tunes](Looney_Tunes "wikilink")-related comedy *[Coyote vs.
Acme](Coyote_vs._Acme "wikilink")* to be released on the same date of
July 21, but in April 2022, the studio announced that the film
*[Barbie](Barbie_(film) "wikilink")* would be released on that date
instead, having it directly compete against Nolan's film.

Nolan's disagreement with Warner was cited as the principal cause of
this decision, with *[Insider](Business_Insider "wikilink")*
speculating that the decision to release the long-in-development
*Barbie* directly opposite *Oppenheimer* may have been revenge against
Nolan for ending his collaboration with the company. The mid-July date
was relevant, beginning with *[The Dark
Knight](The_Dark_Knight "wikilink")* and with the exception of
*[Interstellar](Interstellar_(film) "wikilink")* (which was released in
early November 2014, as distributed by [Paramount
Pictures](Paramount_Pictures "wikilink") in the United States and
Canada, and by Warner Bros. internationally) and
*[Tenet](Tenet_(film) "wikilink")* (which was delayed from the original
release date of July 17, 2020, following the [COVID-19
pandemic](COVID-19_pandemic "wikilink")), Nolan's films have been
released in mid-July. Newly appointed Warner Bros. heads [Michael De
Luca](Michael_De_Luca "wikilink") and [Pamela
Abdy](Pamela_Abdy "wikilink") later stated that they wished to reconcile
with Nolan; box office experts questioned why Warner refused to move
*Barbie*{{'s}} release date if they wished to restore relations with
Nolan. According to [Margot Robbie](Margot_Robbie "wikilink"),
*Oppenheimer* producer [Charles Roven](Charles_Roven "wikilink") called
her and suggested they move the release date for *Barbie*, but she
declined.

Nolan was reportedly annoyed by Warner Bros.' decision to schedule
*Barbie* on the same date as *Oppenheimer*. Despite this , when
asked by an *Insider* reporter whether his split with Warner was indeed
the cause of *Barbie*{{'s}} release date, Nolan laughed and said he was
"not going to answer that question", adding that theaters now have "a
crowded marketplace with a lot of different movies ..., and those of us
who care about movies are thrilled about that". When asked about
the films sharing the same release date, Nolan told an
*[IGN](IGN "wikilink")* reporter that a "crowded marketplace" is "here
and that's terrific".

#### Public reaction

The first known use of the term "Barbenheimer" was in a post on
[Twitter](Twitter "wikilink") dated April 15, 2022, by Matt Neglia,
[editor-in-chief](editor-in-chief "wikilink") of the entertainment
awards website *Next Best Picture*. The post made fun of the fact that
both films seemed to be constantly announcing new cast members. Neglia
later said he did not remember writing the post.

Use of the term gained pace in 2023, as Internet users noted the
juxtaposition of the films and posted memes on Twitter. Fan-made posters
for Barbenheimer circulated online. Shirt designers on
[Etsy](Etsy "wikilink") began creating merchandise based on the
Barbenheimer phenomenon. Early versions of these shirts directly used
the wordmarks of the films and placed them side-by-side, while later
versions used a *Barbie*-inspired "Barbenheimer" wordmark. Several
tweets referenced the Sherbet Homes in [Pacific Palisades, Los
Angeles](Pacific_Palisades,_Los_Angeles "wikilink"), side-by-side homes
noted for one's black demeanor and the other's pink appearance.

Two [Dallas](Dallas "wikilink") video editors made selling Barbenheimer
shirts. Businesses have also posted about the phenomenon; a [Barnes
& Noble](Barnes_&_Noble "wikilink") store in [Olympia,
Washington](Olympia,_Washington "wikilink"), presented a "Barbeinheimer
[Starter Pack](Starter_pack_(meme) "wikilink")" on
[TikTok](TikTok "wikilink"), accruing 30,000 likes.

A retired Boston University professor named Barbara Oppenheimer, a third
cousin through her husband to [J. Robert
Oppenheimer](J._Robert_Oppenheimer "wikilink"), praised both films.

### Marketing

The films' marketing differed greatly. *Barbie*{{'s}} marketing,
estimated to cost $150 million to *Oppenheimer*{{'s}} $100 million, used
a wide range of immersive partnerships and tie-in products.
*Oppenheimer* took a more low-key approach, aiming to cultivate intrigue
with [trailers](Trailer_(promotion) "wikilink") and an online countdown
to the 78th anniversary of the [first nuclear
explosion](Trinity_(nuclear_test) "wikilink").

*Barbie* held a premiere on July 12, 2023, in
[London](London "wikilink"), where *Oppenheimer* held another the
next day; on July 14, [SAG-AFTRA](SAG-AFTRA "wikilink"), an American
[labor union](Trade_union "wikilink") of film, television, and voice
actors, [declared a strike action](2023_SAG-AFTRA_strike "wikilink"),
effectively halting any promotional event that involved any member in
the guild. *Barbie* star [Margot Robbie](Margot_Robbie "wikilink")
showed her support in the action when questioned by a [Sky
News](Sky_News "wikilink") reporter at the film's London event.
Despite *Oppenheimer*{{'s}} London premiere being moved up an hour
early, the cast of the film left during the screening in support of the
strike. SAG-AFTRA President [Fran
Drescher](Fran_Drescher "wikilink") later claimed the studios "duped"
the guild into accepting a 12-day-extension for negotiations to continue
promoting summer films such as *Barbie* and *Oppenheimer*.

### Double feature viewing

Many Hollywood personalities and Internet users have viewed the films as
a [double feature](double_feature "wikilink"), with a debate on
viewing order being part of the meme.

Margot Robbie, who portrays the titular character in *Barbie*, suggested
watching *Barbie*, then *Oppenheimer*, and then *Barbie* again.
President Barbie's actor in *Barbie*, [Issa Rae](Issa_Rae "wikilink"),
said that "If you see *Oppenheimer* last then you might be a bit of a
psychopath." [CNN](CNN "wikilink") Entertainment writer Scottie
Andrew recommended watching *Oppenheimer* first and *Barbie* second,
comparing it to "saving dessert for *after* dinner".

### Counterprogramming

The Barbenheimer phenomenon is an instance of
[counterprogramming](Counterprogramming_(film_distribution) "wikilink"),
a marketing strategy in which a tonally different film is released on
the same day as a major film to appeal to an underrepresented group.
Universal successfully deployed counterprogramming as early as 2002,
when it opened the [dramedy](Comedy_drama "wikilink") *[About a
Boy](About_a_Boy_(film) "wikilink")* opposite the
[science-fiction](Science_fiction "wikilink")
[blockbuster](Blockbuster_(entertainment) "wikilink") *[Star Wars:
Episode II – Attack of the
Clones](Star_Wars:_Episode_II_–_Attack_of_the_Clones "wikilink")*.
The former enjoyed the strongest opening for a British film that year,
finishing with over $130 million.

BBC News observed the phenomenon occur during October 2013 when two very
different Scotland set films, black crime comedy
*[Filth](Filth_(film) "wikilink")*, and romantic musical *[Sunshine on
Leith](Sunshine_on_Leith_(film) "wikilink")* open the same week in the
UK. Men's magazine *[GQ](GQ "wikilink")* observed the phenomenon
occurring in the [holiday
season](Christmas_and_holiday_season "wikilink"), such as *[Avatar: The
Way of Water](Avatar:_The_Way_of_Water "wikilink")* and *[Puss in Boots:
The Last Wish](Puss_in_Boots:_The_Last_Wish "wikilink")* in 2022, and
compared summer to an "all-or-nothing bloodsport". In 2022,
counterprogramming occurred with the summer films *[Top Gun:
Maverick](Top_Gun:_Maverick "wikilink")* and *[The Bob's Burgers
Movie](The_Bob's_Burgers_Movie "wikilink")*, in which the latter is a
smaller film than the former, allowing for such a dynamic.

The release date of *Barbie* and *Oppenheimer* drew parallels to the
same U.S. release date of Nolan's [superhero
film](superhero_film "wikilink") *[The Dark
Knight](The_Dark_Knight "wikilink")* (distributed by Warner Bros.) and
the [jukebox musical](jukebox_musical "wikilink") *[Mamma
Mia!](Mamma_Mia!_(film) "wikilink")* (distributed by Universal) on July
18, 2008. Actor [Tom Cruise](Tom_Cruise "wikilink"), producer and
lead actor of *[Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part
One](Mission:_Impossible_–_Dead_Reckoning_Part_One "wikilink")* which
opened the week before the two films, fervently promoted his film over
*Oppenheimer* and *Barbie* to erode *Oppenheimer*'s three-week
[IMAX](IMAX "wikilink") exclusivity window.

Barbenheimer has seen comparisons to the simultaneous release of the
video game titles *[Animal Crossing: New
Horizons](Animal_Crossing:_New_Horizons "wikilink")* and *[Doom
Eternal](Doom_Eternal "wikilink")* on March 20, 2020, which prompted a
similar online crossover phenomenon at the time. The trend also
appeared with the [series finales](series_finale "wikilink") of the
television series *[Nancy Drew](Nancy_Drew_(2019_TV_series) "wikilink")*
and *[Riverdale](Riverdale_(American_TV_series) "wikilink")*, both of
which aired on August 23, 2023, on [The CW](The_CW "wikilink").

In light of Barbenheimer, other studios concocted similar events to
their upcoming releases. This includes "Saw Patrol", named after *[Saw
X](Saw_X "wikilink")* and *[PAW Patrol: The Mighty
Movie](PAW_Patrol:_The_Mighty_Movie "wikilink")* released September 29,
2023, though this received a more mixed response. In an opposite of
this move however, Universal moved *[The Exorcist:
Believer](The_Exorcist:_Believer "wikilink")* up from its intended
October 13, 2023, date to October 6 to avoid competing with *[Taylor
Swift: The Eras Tour](Taylor_Swift:_The_Eras_Tour "wikilink")* that was
releasing the same day, thus preventing an "Exorswift" release
schedule.

## Reception

### Box office

#### Projections

Going into their opening weekends, *Barbie* was projected to gross
$90–120 million in its opening weekend, and *Oppenheimer* was projected
to gross $45–50 million. Two weeks before their release,
[AMC Theatres](AMC_Theatres "wikilink") announced that more than 20,000
AMC Stubs members had pre-booked tickets to both films on the same day,
resulting in a 33% increase in double-feature tickets from July 7 to
10. On July 17, AMC announced 40,000 members had pre-ordered
tickets. According to cinema chain [Vue
International](Vue_International "wikilink"), nearly one-fifth of people
who bought a ticket for *Oppenheimer* also bought a ticket for
*Barbie*.

The Barbenheimer phenomenon helped boost box-office revenue, which was
still recovering from the [effects of the COVID-19
pandemic](Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_cinema "wikilink") and a
slow [seasonal film
season](Counterprogramming_(film_distribution) "wikilink").

*[The New York Times](The_New_York_Times "wikilink")* called the films'
dual opening weekend "the last happy weekend for many months", as the
[2023 Hollywood labor
disputes](2023_Hollywood_labor_disputes "wikilink") would likely delay
the release of films expected to be award-season contenders.

#### Gross

Both films exceeded box-office expectations. *Barbie* became
the highest-grossing domestic release in [Warner
Bros](Warner_Bros "wikilink") history, surpassing Nolan's *The Dark
Knight*. In the United States and Canada, *Barbie* grossed
$22.3 million in Thursday night previews, while *Oppenheimer* grossed
$10.5 million. This was the first time two movies released in the same
weekend have grossed more than $10 million each in their previews.
Including previews, the films made $70.5 million and $33 million on
their first days, respectively, which led to weekend projections being
increased to $160 million and $77 million. The films went on to debut to
$162 million and $82.4 million, respectively. The Barbenheimer
phenomenon was credited with boosting interest in the films, with a
total of 79% of tickets sold over the weekend (52% for *Barbie* and 27%
for *Oppenheimer*) being for the two films, a total of 18.5 million
people. Additionally, *Oppenheimer* made $4.98 million from
audience members who saw the film because their desired *Barbie*
showtime was sold out. [IMAX](IMAX "wikilink") CEO [Richard
Gelfond](Richard_Gelfond "wikilink") described the weekend as a paradigm
shift, referring to *Oppenheimer* bringing in $35 million from 740 IMAX
screens. *Oppenheimer* saw the second-largest opening not to top the
domestic box office, falling short of [*Inside
Out*](Inside_Out_(2015_film) "wikilink"){{'s}} $90.4 million opening by
a small margin. *Barbie* and *Oppenheimer* led the July 21–23
weekend to a total revenue of $310.8 million, making it the
fourth-largest aggregate domestic weekend ever, behind the weekends led
by the openings of *[Avengers: Endgame](Avengers:_Endgame "wikilink")*
(April 26–28, 2019, $402 million), *[Avengers: Infinity
War](Avengers:_Infinity_War "wikilink")* (April 27–29, 2018, $314
million), and *[Star Wars: The Force
Awakens](Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens "wikilink")* (December 18–20,
2015, $313 million).

Barbenheimer boosted box office values to their highest point since 2019
as part of a series of "unusual blockbusters". Summer 2023 film releases
featured underperformances from franchise films, bucking a 10-year run
of the highest-grossing summer movies being sequels. The Barbenheimer
"jolt" arrived while the 2023 summer box office was 7 percent behind the
2022 season; by [Labor Day](Labor_Day "wikilink"), the U.S summer box
office had reached $4.1 billion, 19 percent ahead of the 2022 box office
by the same date.

### Film industry reaction

Tom Cruise, whom director [Steven
Spielberg](Steven_Spielberg "wikilink") proclaimed had "saved
Hollywood's ass" with the success of *Top Gun: Maverick* the previous
year, referred to *Barbie* and *Oppenheimer* as a double feature in
a [Twitter](Twitter "wikilink") post along with photographs of him and
*Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One* director [Christopher
McQuarrie](Christopher_McQuarrie "wikilink") with tickets to the two
films. Similarly, Gerwig and *Barbie* star [Margot
Robbie](Margot_Robbie "wikilink") were featured in photographs on the
*Barbie* Twitter holding up tickets to *Oppenheimer*, as well as
*Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One*. At the premiere of
*[Air](Air_(2023_film) "wikilink")*, actor and *Oppenheimer* star [Matt
Damon](Matt_Damon "wikilink") told *[Vanity
Fair](Vanity_Fair_(magazine) "wikilink")* that audiences are "allowed to
go see two movies in a weekend". Director [Francis Ford
Coppola](Francis_Ford_Coppola "wikilink") called the box office success
of both films "a victory for cinema". Director [Martin
Scorsese](Martin_Scorsese "wikilink") called the event a "perfect storm"
that offered hope for a "different cinema to emerge."

At the world premiere of *Barbie* in [Los
Angeles](Los_Angeles "wikilink"), Gerwig and [Issa
Rae](Issa_Rae "wikilink") praised the double feature concept. Rae said,
"I love that there's solidarity though where people tried to pit us
against one another but now it's turned into like a double-feature
situation". In an interview with *[La
Vanguardia](La_Vanguardia "wikilink")*, *Oppenheimer* star [Cillian
Murphy](Cillian_Murphy "wikilink") endorsed the phenomenon, saying, "My
advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are
good films, then that's cinema's gain." At the
[London](London "wikilink") premiere for *Barbie*, Robbie said she wants
a Barbenheimer shirt signed by Murphy.

### Japanese response

The Barbenheimer phenomenon sparked negative reactions in
[Japan](Japan "wikilink"), where *Oppenheimer* is seen as a
controversial film due to its title character's association with the
[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki](atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki "wikilink"), and
was not screened until the following year, 29 March 2024. When the
live-action *Barbie* film's official Twitter account (@barbiethemovie)
reacted favorably to image designs created by fans that incorporated the
[mushroom cloud](mushroom_cloud "wikilink") of and fire from an atomic
bomb and punning "it will be a blast", it was met with heavy
backlash within Japan. This was attributed to Japan's
educational emphasis on the destruction caused by nuclear weapons, as
the only country to have been attacked by them in an armed conflict. As
a result, mushroom clouds and atomic bombs were considered inappropriate
for casual or comedic usage. The timing of the incidents also
coincided with the 78th anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki
bombings. *Barbie* was also released in Japan on August 11, 2023,
just two days after the 78th anniversary of the bombing of
Nagasaki. A [Change.org](Change.org "wikilink") petition demanding
an apology from the official *Barbie* Twitter account was launched,
acquiring over 22,600 signatures. The hashtag \#NoBarbenheimer
trended on Twitter, with over 100,000 retweets. Some Japanese users
also made memes showing the [Twin
Towers](World_Trade_Center_(1973–2001) "wikilink") [with pink
smoke](September_11_attacks "wikilink") or Barbie hanging out with
[Osama bin Laden](Osama_bin_Laden "wikilink") to show Americans their
perspective on the atomic bombings, though this is widely viewed as
having backfired due to many Americans' taste for [9/11
humor](Humor_based_on_the_September_11_attacks "wikilink").

The Japanese branch of Warner Bros. issued a statement of regret on July
31, 2023 ([JST](Japan_Standard_Time "wikilink")) through its own Twitter
account for the *Barbie* film (@BarbieMovie\_jp), condemning the actions
of the U.S. headquarters and urging them to "take appropriate action."
On the night of July 31, 2023 ([PST](Pacific_Time_Zone "wikilink")),
Warner's headquarters issued a statement to news outlets, writing that
it regrets "its recent insensitive social media engagement" and that it
"offers a sincere apology ", and the *Barbie* film's American Twitter
account reportedly began to delete the replies in
question. [Mitsuki
Takahata](Mitsuki_Takahata "wikilink"), who provides the voice of Barbie
in the Japanese dub of the film, voiced her disappointment on her
[Instagram](Instagram "wikilink") account and stated that she had
considered dropping out of a promotional event planned to take place on
August 11, 2023.

### Analysis

*[The Economist](The_Economist "wikilink")* observed that the "two films
encapsulate some of the caprices of the modern movie industry", with
*Barbie* being an [IP](Intellectual_property "wikilink")-driven film
projected to gross twice as much (in its opening weekend) as
*Oppenheimer*, a [standalone](Standalone_film "wikilink") film. The
paper also concluded that, in the advent of the increased [nuclear
anxiety](nuclear_anxiety "wikilink") following the [Russian invasion of
Ukraine](Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "wikilink") and developments around
the nuclear arsenals of
[China](China_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction "wikilink") and [North
Korea](North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction "wikilink"),
audiences are less willing to see a [realist](Realism_(arts) "wikilink")
drama film such as *Oppenheimer* than they are eager to see an
[escapist](Escapist_fiction "wikilink") comedy film such as *Barbie*,
recalling similar instances of the dynamic in American film
history. Senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian of
[Comscore](Comscore "wikilink") opined that the Barbenheimer phenomenon
was unprecedented, feeling that ordinarily, the simultaneous release of
two significant films would have "cannibalized" each other, but in the
case of Barbenheimer, would be "additive and complementary". He believes
that the phenomenon would attract a wide demographic, with older
audiences hearing about *Oppenheimer* through review pieces and
listening to the radio, while *Barbie* would draw a big audience on its
opening weekend because its '[fear of missing
out](fear_of_missing_out "wikilink")' factor "is going to be off the
charts".

Writing for *FirstShowing*, Alex Billington compared how philosophical
both films were, citing concepts present in each such as
[existentialism](existentialism "wikilink"), [Marcel
Proust](Marcel_Proust "wikilink"), and how both protagonists discover
truth similar to [Plato's Cave](Plato's_Cave "wikilink"). [Slavoj
Žižek](Slavoj_Žižek "wikilink"), in *[The New
Statesman](The_New_Statesman "wikilink")*, argues that both films
feature main characters that attempt to escape fantasy and uncover a
deeper reality, only to discover that their reality itself is
constituted in relation to fantasy.

Though the Internet joke began as a reference to the two films' seeming
differences, some writers have pointed out similarities between them,
including that "Nolan and Gerwig are both \[Oscar-nominated\] directors,
both have huge ensemble casts of stars, and they are both produced by
husband and wife production companies". Writing for *[The
Escapist](The_Escapist_(magazine) "wikilink")*, critic Darren Mooney
also found similarities between the two films, noting that both "are
about the relationship that exists between imagination and reality, as
well as about what happens when ideas begin to manifest themselves in
the corporeal world. In both cases, the results are fundamentally
terrifying, although the movies reach decidedly different
conclusions." Sonia Rao of *[The Washington
Post](The_Washington_Post "wikilink")* notes that the two films share a
common notion: "The corruptibility of men". Also in the *[The
Washington Post](The_Washington_Post "wikilink")*, Tyler Austin Harper
wrote that both films explore the theoretical notion of the
[Anthropocene](Anthropocene "wikilink"), the geological epoch defined by
humanity's impact: "Despite their apparent differences, both *Barbie*
and *Oppenheimer* tell the story of core ideas of the 20th century:
accelerating militarism and unbounded consumption, ideas which might
well outlive our species in the form of plastic and plutonium's
lingering traces across our fragile planet."

Jake Coyle of the [Associated Press](Associated_Press "wikilink")
analyzed the box office gross of *Barbie* and *Oppenheimer* and noted
that their success may point to audiences wanting more originality in
films, following "flopbusters" like *[The
Flash](The_Flash_(film) "wikilink")* and *[Indiana Jones and the Dial of
Destiny](Indiana_Jones_and_the_Dial_of_Destiny "wikilink")*, both of
which became [box-office bombs](box-office_bomb "wikilink").
Writing for IndieWire, Eric Kohn repeated the sentiment, "audiences want
originality and invention, not endless sequels", suggesting studios
would benefit from cultivating young, visionary directors at [film
festivals](film_festivals "wikilink"). Kohn also cautioned that rather
than attempting to replicate Barbenheimer's success, studios would
benefit more by considering why it can’t be replicated. 

Journalist Larissa Kuhnert from German newspaper *[Neues
Deutschland](Neues_Deutschland "wikilink")* attributed the success of
the phenomenon to [astroturfing](astroturfing "wikilink").
According to journalist Thomas Koch from the German magazine
*[Wirtschaftswoche](Wirtschaftswoche "wikilink")*, the success of
Barbenheimer is said to have been planned by Mattel Marketing.

### Reviews

Of critics reviewing the double feature, an
*[SFGate](SFGate "wikilink")* reviewer who watched *Barbie* first judged
it to be the better film and "kinda hope\[d\]" Gerwig would make a film
about Oppenheimer. An *[IndieWire](IndieWire "wikilink")* reviewer
who watched *Oppenheimer* first (with several audience members dressed
in pink and one wearing a *Barbenheimer* T-shirt) said the films worked
"decently" as a double feature. On the other hand, a reviewer in
*[The Guardian](The_Guardian "wikilink")* who also watched *Oppenheimer*
first compared the experience to
[whiplash](whiplash_(medicine) "wikilink") and to "having your mother's
funeral invaded by a flashmob of parking circus clowns". In a
paired review in *[The New Yorker](The_New_Yorker "wikilink")* that
criticized both films, [Anthony Lane](Anthony_Lane "wikilink") found
similarity in performances that, in his opinion, threaten to overshadow
the starring roles: "\[J\]ust as Downey \[[Robert Downey
Jr.](Robert_Downey_Jr. "wikilink"), as [Lewis
Strauss](Lewis_Strauss "wikilink")\] threatens to pull Nolan's film out
of orbit, so, in "Barbie," does Gosling \[[Ryan
Gosling](Ryan_Gosling "wikilink"), as [Ken](Ken_(doll) "wikilink")\]
attract a dangerous share of the dramatic energy". The review also noted
that in both films, characters describe the premise of the film as
"impossible".
