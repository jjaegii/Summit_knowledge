# Swifties

**Swifties** are the [fandom](fandom "wikilink") of the American
singer-songwriter [Taylor Swift](Taylor_Swift "wikilink"). Regarded by
journalists as one of the largest, most devoted and influential fan
bases, Swifties are known for their high levels of participation,
creativity, community and [fanaticism](fanaticism "wikilink"). They are
a subject of widespread coverage in the [mainstream
media](mainstream_media "wikilink").

Critics have opined that Swift has redefined artist–fandom relationships
by establishing an intimate connection with Swifties. She has frequently
engaged with, helped, credited and prioritized her fans, while the
latter have offered unprecedented support and interest in her works
irrespective of [her wavering reception in the
media](Public_image_of_Taylor_Swift "wikilink"). They continued to
support Swift through her genre transitions and unexpected artistic
pivots, helped her during her highly publicized controversies such as
[the 2019 masters dispute](Taylor_Swift_masters_dispute "wikilink"),
instigated the [political scrutiny of
Ticketmaster](Taylor_Swift–Ticketmaster_controversy "wikilink") that led
to implementation of various laws, and stimulated economic growth with
the cultural [impact of the Eras
Tour](impact_of_the_Eras_Tour "wikilink"). Swift's releases, promotional
efforts and fashion have garnered attention for incorporating [Easter
eggs](Easter_egg_(media) "wikilink") and clues that are decoded by
Swifties and considered part of her [musical
universe](Worldbuilding "wikilink"). The word Swiftie(s) was added to
the *[Oxford Dictionary of
English](Oxford_Dictionary_of_English "wikilink")* in 2023.

Swifties have had an impact on the [music
industry](music_industry "wikilink") and [popular
culture](popular_culture "wikilink"). [Cultural
analyses](Cultural_analysis "wikilink") have variably described them as
a [community of interest](community_of_interest "wikilink"), a
[subculture](subculture "wikilink"), and a
near-[metaverse](metaverse "wikilink"), while academics have studied
them for their [consumerism](consumerism "wikilink"), content creation,
[social capital](social_capital "wikilink"), [collective
effervescence](collective_effervescence "wikilink"), organizing
prolificacy, and [interpersonal
relationships](interpersonal_relationship "wikilink"). Swifties have
also been a subject of criticism, with some members of the fanbase
displaying disregard for Swift's privacy by publicizing her real-time
locations. Media outlets have reported that some online Swifties engage
in [verbal attack](Verbal_abuse "wikilink") of individuals, including
celebrities, who malign Swift.

## History

[Taylor Swift](Taylor_Swift "wikilink") began writing, recording and
releasing [country music](country_music "wikilink") in 2006. Before
releasing her debut single, "[Tim McGraw](Tim_McGraw_(song) "wikilink")"
(2006), Swift had been using [social networking
websites](Social_networking_service "wikilink"). She was one of the
first country artists to use the [Internet](Internet "wikilink") as a
[marketing](marketing "wikilink") tool for her music, predominantly
promoting herself on [Myspace](Myspace "wikilink") and connecting with
listeners who liked her music when it played on radio. She
created her MySpace account on August 31, 2005, a day before her
then-label, [Big Machine Records](Big_Machine_Records "wikilink"), was
inaugurated. Swift's songs on MySpace collected more than 45 million
listens, which [Scott Borchetta](Scott_Borchetta "wikilink"), the label
CEO, provided to "skeptical" country radio programmers to convince them
of existing fans for Swift's songs.

Swift released her [self-titled debut studio
album](Taylor_Swift_(album) "wikilink") in the United States in October
2006. It sold 40,000 copies in its first week, but became a [sleeper
hit](sleeper_hit "wikilink") as its sales remained consistent over
time, reaching one million copies in November 2007. It garnered
its highest sales week in January 2008, with 187,000 copies. This
sleeper success contributed to a rapid increase in Swift's notability
within and beyond the country music scene. *Taylor Swift* spent 24 weeks
at the number-one spot of the U.S. [Top Country
Albums](Top_Country_Albums "wikilink") chart and became the
longest-running album from the 2000s decade on the all-genre
[*Billboard* 200](Billboard_200 "wikilink"). Her follow-up album,
*[Fearless](Fearless_(Taylor_Swift_album) "wikilink")*, was released in
November 2008 and became [the best-selling album of
2009](List_of_best-selling_albums_by_year_in_the_United_States "wikilink").
It achieved significant international success beyond the
[Anglosphere](Anglosphere "wikilink"), where country music was
then not popular, and its singles "[Love
Story](Love_Story_(Taylor_Swift_song) "wikilink")" and "[You Belong with
Me](You_Belong_with_Me "wikilink")" became crossover successes on [pop
radio](pop_radio "wikilink"), catapulting Swift to mainstream fame
and widening her audience. The success planted dedicated
fanbases for Swift in overseas markets such as the United Kingdom,
Ireland, Brazil, Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, India, and
Japan. Her subsequent albums, which saw her experiment with
[pop](Pop_music "wikilink"), [rock](Rock_music "wikilink"),
[electronic](Electronic_music "wikilink"),
[folk](Contemporary_folk_music "wikilink"), and
[alternative](Alternative_rock "wikilink") styles, helped largen her
fanbase and diversify its [demographics](Demography "wikilink") in the
following decades.

### Etymology

The word "Swiftie" for a Swift fan gained popularity in the late 2000s.
[Etymologically](Etymology "wikilink"), the word is formed from Swift's
name and the [suffix](suffix "wikilink") "ie" (or sometimes "y" as in
"Swifty"), which is often used in [diminutives](diminutive "wikilink")
to imply affection. Swift stated in a 2012 [Vevo](Vevo "wikilink")
interview that her fans call themselves "Swifties", which she found
"adorable". Swift filed the term for
[trademark](trademark "wikilink") in March 2017. In 2023, *[Oxford
Dictionary of English](Oxford_Dictionary_of_English "wikilink")* defined
Swiftie as a [noun](noun "wikilink") meaning "an enthusiastic fan of the
singer Taylor Swift." As per the dictionary, some words that
[collocate](Collocation "wikilink") with Swiftie in popular usage are
"fandom", "die-hard", "hardcore" and "self-proclaimed". According to
*[Dictionary.com](Dictionary.com "wikilink")*, the term Swiftie often
implies that the person is "a very passionate and loyal fan—as opposed
to just a casual listener."

## Relationship with Swift

Swift maintains a close relationship with Swifties, to whom many
journalists attribute her cultural influence. To *[The
Washington Post](The_Washington_Post "wikilink")*, Swift and Swifties
are "all part of one big friend group". She has "revolutionized" the
relationship a celebrity can have with fans, according to *[The New York
Times](The_New_York_Times "wikilink")*. Many fans feel connected to
her as they "have grown up with her and her music." Lora Kelley
of *[The Atlantic](The_Atlantic "wikilink")* stated that Swift
"understands the power of the group experience." Her connection with
fans is considered unique for artists of her stature; she has interacted
with them on social media, sent them gifts, hand-selected them to attend
intimate concerts or meet-and-greets, made surprise visits, participated
in some of their functions (such as a [wedding](wedding "wikilink") or a
[bridal shower](bridal_shower "wikilink")), and gifted free tickets to
disadvantaged or medically ill fans. Swift's habit of
lurking her fans online has been referred to as "Taylurking" by the
fans.

In June 2010, Swift hosted a 13-hour meet-and-greet as a part of the
[CMA Festival](CMJ "wikilink") in [Nashville,
Tennessee](Nashville,_Tennessee "wikilink"). In 2014, 2017 and 2019, she
hosted the "Secret Sessions", a series of pre-release album-listening
parties for fans at her houses, and a 2014
[Christmas](Christmas "wikilink") event dubbed by the fans as the
"Swiftmas," where Swift sent packages of early Christmas presents to
fans and hand-delivered some of them. Swift has also written songs
in honor of her fans, such as "[Long
Live](Long_Live_(Taylor_Swift_song) "wikilink")" (2010) or
"[Ronan](Ronan_(song) "wikilink")" (2012); the latter is a [charity
record](charity_record "wikilink") about a fan's four-year-old son who
died of [neuroblastoma](neuroblastoma "wikilink"). In 2023, she
invited 2,200 fans to the world premiere of her concert film, *[Taylor
Swift: The Eras Tour](Taylor_Swift:_The_Eras_Tour "wikilink")*, free of
cost. Zoya Raza-Sheikh of *[The
Independent](The_Independent "wikilink")* reported that Swift "remains
at the forefront of delivering fan-based experiences to cultivate an
ever-growing following. Whether it's personal invites to the singer's
house for album listening parties, aka Secret Sessions, or pre-show
hangouts, she continues to put her fans first."

With her large fanbase, Swift is one of the most followed people on [social
media](social_media "wikilink"). According to ticketing
executive Nathan Hubbard, Swift was the first musician ever "to be
natively online." *[Rolling Stone](Rolling_Stone "wikilink")* critic
Brittany Spanos opined that Swift grew her fanbase on social media: "She
was using [Tumblr](Tumblr "wikilink") way past its prime.
[Twitter](Twitter "wikilink"). She's now on [TikTok](TikTok "wikilink"),
commenting on people's videos." The part of TikTok dominated by
Swifties is known as "SwiftTok". A 2024 qualitative study of
Swifties credited "Swift's constant self-disclosure and authentic
persona on social media" for the Swifties' exceptional relationship with
Swift.

The nicknames generally used by Swifties for Swift include "Blondie"
(referencing her blonde hair), "T-Swizzle" (after the lyrics in Swift's
2009 [parody](parody "wikilink") song "[Thug
Story](List_of_songs_by_Taylor_Swift#Other_songs "wikilink")" with
American record producer [T-Pain](T-Pain "wikilink")), and "The Music
Industry" (referring to [her influence on the music
industry](Cultural_impact_of_Taylor_Swift "wikilink")). Chinese
Swifties dubbed her "Meimei" (霉霉), a [pun](pun "wikilink") based on
the [Chinese character](Chinese_characters "wikilink") "Mei" (霉) for
"unlucky" that has since been adopted by [Chinese state
media](Mass_media_in_China "wikilink").

She has donated to fans to cover their academic loans, medical bills,
rent or other expenses. In 2018, she bought a house for a homeless
and pregnant fan. Her high donation to a fan with
[leukemia](leukemia "wikilink") on [GoFundMe](GoFundMe "wikilink") in
2015 caused the [crowdfunding](crowdfunding "wikilink") platform to
expand its policy. In 2023, thousands of Swifties collectively
donated US$125,000 via GoFundMe to the family of a fellow Swiftie who
was struck and killed by a drunk driver on his way home from a Swift
concert. Much of the donated amount was given in portions of $13,
Swift's favorite number.

## Lore and community

Journalists describe Swift's works, celebrity, and the fanfare
surrounding them as a world of its own, dubbing it a music
"[universe](Shared_universe "wikilink")" subject to analyses by
Swifties. Propagated by her prolific use of [Easter
eggs](Easter_egg_(media) "wikilink") and "unusually close connection
with her fans", Swift is a source of [myth](myth "wikilink") in
popular culture. Her outfits, accessories,
[diction](diction "wikilink"), color coding, and
[numerology](numerology "wikilink") have also been Easter eggs.
Swifties are known for their fan theories, having gained a reputation as
"the best online sleuths" for breaking down and associating various
elements they consider as clues or Easter eggs. According to
Bruce Arthur of *[Toronto Star](Toronto_Star "wikilink")*, "Swift is
followed by fans whose dedication to her mythology is Byzantine and
layered and complex and messianic."

*[Glamour](Glamour_(magazine) "wikilink")* and *The Washington Post*
termed the lore as the Taylor Swift Cinematic Universe.
*Entertainment Weekly* called it Taylor Swift Musical Universe—"a pop
star known for prodigious hint-dropping, whose fans turn every piece of
info into an online [archaeological
dig](Archaeological_excavation "wikilink")." In *The Guardian*,
Adrian Horton said "Swiftverse" is a [subculture](subculture "wikilink")
of mass media, cultivated by "years of
[worldbuilding](worldbuilding "wikilink") and Swiftian mythology",
while Alim Kheraj wrote Swift turned pop music into a "multiplayer
puzzle" involving fanbase commitment, which other artists have attempted
to reproduce.

Andrew Unterberger of *[Spin](Spin_(magazine) "wikilink")* wrote that
symbolisms are "inextricable elements of the Taylor Swift experience"
and key to understanding her work. To Caroline Mimbs Nyce of *The
Atlantic*, Swift's fandom is nearly a [metaverse](metaverse "wikilink"):
"a huge virtual community unmoored from a single platform, based on a
world around Taylor Swift, missing only the 3D virtual space to hang out
in." According to Yahr, Swift enjoys embedding "clues, hints and
puzzles" in her works, social media posts and interviews, constructing a
self-mythology that fans believe could have a hidden meaning and attempt
to decode, such as a release date, song or album title or an artistic
element. Madeline Merinuk of
*[Today](Today_(American_TV_program) "wikilink")* observed how Swift's
easter eggs, which originated as short messages hidden within elaborate
CD packaging, have become more innovative and intricate over time.
The critical analysis is referred to as "Swiftology" in the
media. For instance, "[the
scarf](All_Too_Well#The_scarf "wikilink")" mentioned in "All Too Well"
has been a topic of mythology.

Swift is known for her album rollouts and promotional concepts, often
referred to as "eras". Each era is characterized by an
aesthetic idea, color palette, mood, and a fashion style. As
such, Swift has reinvented her image and style throughout her career,
which Ashley Lutz of *[Fortune](Fortune_(magazine) "wikilink")* felt
aided in broadening her fanbase. *Today* senior editor Elena
Nicolaou reported on how Swifties, who are mostly
[millennials](millennials "wikilink"), have incorporated Swiftie culture
into their weddings and other events.

### Sociological characteristics

Swifties have been described as a loyal fanbase with high levels of
participation and creativity; devoted fans in overseas countries
such as China translate her lyrics and coordinate large-scale
Swift-related events. Their positive reception of *Reputation,*
which was released after her 2016 controversy, demonstrated their
commitment to her, irrespective of a tonal shift in her artistry and
public perception. *Billboard* wrote the unprecedented success of
Swift's re-recorded albums was further evidence of their loyalty.
According to Willman, the re-records' success inspired other artists to
"weaponize fans in their business disputes". Author [Amanda
Petrusich](Amanda_Petrusich "wikilink") described Swifties' allegiance
as both "mighty and frightening". *The Guardian* critic Rachel
Aroesti wrote, "You can't argue with her fanbase, immaculately devout
and mind-bogglingly populous."

The [consumerist](consumerist "wikilink") phenomenon of participating in
or purchasing anything related to Swift has been termed "the Taylor
Swift effect" by publications. To business scientists
Brendan Canavan and Claire McCamley, the relationship between Swift and
Swifties represents [post-postmodern](Post-postmodernism "wikilink")
consumerism. [Sociologist](Sociologist "wikilink") Brian Donovan opined,
"it is easy to dismiss the frenzy surrounding Swift as mindless
[hero](hero "wikilink") worship. Yet, the Swifties have shown the power
of fandom to create social bonds that transcend consumerism." He
praised Swift's ability to "tap into the collector mindset in her
fandom". Arthur opined, "People like to frame Swifties as an
extreme case, but it sort of functions the same way as in sports."

The fan frenzy, generally termed "Swiftmania", has been considered the 
21st-century equivalent to [Beatlemania](Beatlemania "wikilink") by 
journalists such as Jon Bream of *[Star Tribune](Star_Tribune "wikilink")*, 
who said "Swift has achieved a once unthinkable monoculture, a zeitgeistian 
redux of Beatlemania". Shows and television programs featuring
Swift often experience viewership peaks due to Swifties.
Apart from music artists who have cited Swift as an influence, such
as [Olivia Rodrigo](Olivia_Rodrigo "wikilink"),
[Halsey](Halsey_(singer) "wikilink") and [Camila
Cabello](Camila_Cabello "wikilink"), various other celebrities have
described themselves as Swifties.

## Industrial impact

Swifties have been widely covered for their support for Swift in terms
of her commercial success. Swift is known for her large CD and
[vinyl](Phonograph_record "wikilink") sales despite the 21st-century
music scene having shifted to a largely digital industry. From 2014
to 2015, Swift contested music streaming services
[Spotify](Spotify "wikilink") and [Apple Music](Apple_Music "wikilink")
to regulate their policies to protect [artists'
integrity](Artistic_integrity "wikilink"). She announced that
*1989*, her first-ever [pop music](pop_music "wikilink") album, would
not release on Spotify, protesting the platform's "minuscule" payments
to musicians. Some journalists, such as Nilay Patel of
*[Vox](Vox_(website) "wikilink"),* criticized Swift's beliefs; Patel
said that the Internet sabotaged the [album
format](Album_era "wikilink") and claimed that most fans would not shop
for a Swift CD anymore. Many industry personnel felt that Swift's
departure from country music and streaming platforms would impact the
album's sales. Publications predicted *1989* to not sell over one
million copies in its first week like her previous albums *[Speak
Now](Speak_Now "wikilink")* (2010) and
*[Red](Red_(Taylor_Swift_album) "wikilink")* (2012) did.
However, *1989* was an unprecedented success for Swift despite the lack
of streaming support, widely purchased by fans as CDs from
[Target](Target_Corporation "wikilink"); the album sold 1.28
million copies in its opening week. In the
[2020s](2020s_in_music "wikilink"), Swifties have also been credited
with being one of the factors behind the [vinyl
revival](vinyl_revival "wikilink"). Swift's album
[LP](LP_record "wikilink") variants have been sold exclusively at small
businesses, driving their profits.

Swift's fans increased the publicity surrounding [her 2019 masters
dispute](Taylor_Swift_masters_dispute "wikilink") with Big Machine and
American businessman [Scooter Braun](Scooter_Braun "wikilink") and drove
the success of her re-recording efforts. An online
petition launched by a fan on [Change.org](Change.org "wikilink"),
calling Braun and Borchetta "to stop holding Swift's art hostage",
garnered 35,000 plaintiffs in its first three hours. Michael Jones, a
managing director of Change.org, described the petition as "one the
fastest-growing petitions on the platform this month". Braun,
however, claimed that Swift "weaponized" her fanbase by making the
dispute public. Swifties also discovered that the Carlyle Group, a
partner of Braun in the dispute, supplies weapons to [the civil war in
Yemen](Yemeni_Civil_War_(2014–present) "wikilink"), which was confirmed
by publications such as *The New York Times*.

Swift's works, including concert tours such as [the Eras
Tour](the_Eras_Tour "wikilink"), are known to stimulate surrounding
economies. The economic impact—driven largely by Swifties and
attributed to the "booming" travel, [lodging](lodging "wikilink"),
[cosmetic](Cosmetic_industry "wikilink"), fashion, and food
businesses—boosts [tourism](tourism "wikilink") revenues of cities
by large margins. The *[Los Angeles
Times](Los_Angeles_Times "wikilink")* described Swifties as an economic
microcosm.** In November 2022, the U.S. pre-sale of the Eras Tour
was mishandled by [Ticketmaster](Ticketmaster "wikilink"), receiving
[widespread public and political
scrutiny](Taylor_Swift–Ticketmaster_controversy "wikilink"). Due to
"astronomical" fan demand, the Ticketmaster website
[crashed](Crash_(computing) "wikilink") but 2.4 million tickets had been
sold, breaking the record for the most concert tickets sold by an artist
in a single day. Ticketmaster attributed the crash to "historically
unprecedented" [site traffic](Internet_traffic "wikilink").
Fans and [consumer groups](Consumer_organization "wikilink") accused
Ticketmaster of deceit and [monopoly](monopoly "wikilink"). The
intense fan reactions caused several members of [U.S.
Congress](United_States_Congress "wikilink") to highlight the
[merger](Mergers_and_acquisitions "wikilink") of Ticketmaster and its
parent company [Live Nation
Entertainment](Live_Nation_Entertainment "wikilink"), and the [U.S.
Department of Justice](United_States_Department_of_Justice "wikilink")
to open an investigation into Live Nation–Ticketmaster, while
several fans sued the companies for intentional deception, fraud, [price
fixing](price_fixing "wikilink"), and [antitrust
law](United_States_antitrust_law "wikilink") violations. Under
pressure from U.S. president [Joe Biden](Joe_Biden "wikilink"),
Ticketmaster and other ticketing companies agreed to terminate [junk
fees](junk_fees "wikilink"). *Entertainment Weekly* and *[The A.V.
Club](The_A.V._Club "wikilink")* listed "Swifties vs. Ticketmaster" as
one of the biggest cultural news stories of 2022. CNN
journalist Allison Morrow wrote in an article titled "One Nation, Under
Swift" that Swift's fans united the parties against Ticketmaster in a
way "the [Founding
Fathers](Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States "wikilink") failed to
anticipate".

Noticing the growing trend of Swift-themed dance parties in the world,
industry commentators found that Swift's cultural position as a staple
in the 21st-century music landscape allowed
[nightclubs](nightclub "wikilink") to profit from her by hosting
specialized events for fans. One such party is
"Swiftogeddon", which began as a one-off Swiftie event in
[London](London "wikilink") and grew into a U.K.-wide club-night tour
that sells out every weekend. American [reality
television](reality_television "wikilink") programs such as *[Dancing
with the Stars](Dancing_with_the_Stars_(American_TV_series) "wikilink")*
and *[The Voice](The_Voice_(American_TV_series) "wikilink")* hosted
special Swift-themed nights in 2023. Swiftie trends have also
inspired various brands. *The A.V. Club* stated that "usually, pop stars
are products and fandom is the consumer", but Swifties are a product
themselves. For instance, the phrase "seemingly
[ranch](Ranch_dressing "wikilink")" became viral after a fan account on
Twitter used it to caption a photo of Swift's snacks at a [National
Football League](National_Football_League "wikilink") (NFL) game,
spawning a string of [memes](meme "wikilink") and causing [food
companies](Food_industry "wikilink") like [Heinz](Heinz "wikilink"),
[McDonald's](McDonald's "wikilink"), [KFC](KFC "wikilink"), [Hidden
Valley](Hidden_Valley_Ranch "wikilink") and [Primal
Kitchen](Primal_Kitchen "wikilink") to pick it up for their products and
marketing.

## Demographics

According to a 2023 survey by [Morning
Consult](Morning_Consult "wikilink"), in the U.S., 53% of adults said
they were fans of Swift, of whom 44% identified as Swifties and 16% as
her "avid" fans. Of the fans, 52% were women while 48% were men.
Racially, the 74% of the fans were white, 13% were
[Black](Black_people "wikilink"), 9% were
[Asian](Asian_Americans "wikilink"), and 4% from other races.
Politically, 55% of the fans were
[Democratic](Democratic_Party_(United_States) "wikilink"), 23% were
[Republican](Republican_Party_(United_States) "wikilink"), and 23% were
[independent](Independent_voter "wikilink"). In terms of generations,
45% are millennials, 23% are [baby boomers](baby_boomers "wikilink"),
21% are [Generation X](Generation_X "wikilink"), and 11% are [Generation
Z](Generation_Z "wikilink"). Journalists have also noted an
increase in Swift's boomer and Generation X fans, known as
"[senior](Old_age "wikilink") Swifties".

### Political role

Brooke Schultz of the [Associated Press](Associated_Press "wikilink")
called Swifties an influential voter demographic in U.S. politics: "the
sheer power and size of Swift's fandom has spurred conversations about
[economic inequality](economic_inequality "wikilink"), merely symbolized
by Ticketmaster". According to a 2023 survey reported by *[The
Times](The_Times "wikilink")*, 53% adult Americans consider themselves
"fans" of Swift, ratings that journalist Ellie Austin said Biden and
Trump "can only dream of". Austin explained that though Swift herself is
[left-aligned](Left-wing_politics "wikilink"), some conservatives still
"covet" her, making her a deciding factor in the U.S. politics. In
May 2023, Texas approved the law titled "Save Our Swifties", banning the
use of bots to bulk-purchase tickets. Similar bills were
launched in various U.S. states and the [U.S.
Congress](U.S._Congress "wikilink"). Internationally,
presidential candidates such as [Gabriel
Boric](Gabriel_Boric "wikilink") in Chile and [Leni
Robredo](Leni_Robredo "wikilink") in the Philippines have appealed or
marketed themselves to Swifties during their respective election
campaigns.

## Criticism

Swifties have received criticism for certain behaviors. Journalists have
denounced the [parasocial
interactions](parasocial_interaction "wikilink") that some Swifties have
with Swift, including excessive interest in Swift's private
life. Fans have swarmed locations where she is spotted.
Swift herself has spoken about her lack of privacy many times. In *Miss
Americana*, when Swift leaves her [Tribeca](Tribeca "wikilink")
apartment surrounded by fans and spectators outside her door, she states
that she is "highly aware of the fact that that is not normal."

Some fans have also been reported to attack, harass or send [death
threats](death_threats "wikilink") online to, and
[dox](Doxing "wikilink") other celebrities, journalists, and Internet
users for various reasons, such as speaking negatively of
Swift. Following the masters dispute, Braun claimed that
he received death threats from Swifties.
*[Vice](Vice_(magazine) "wikilink")* called the fandom an "equal-parts
welcoming yet gate-kept community caught in the throes of idealistic,
obsessive [celebrity culture](celebrity_culture "wikilink")".

### Gaylor

Gaylor is a [conspiracy theory](conspiracy_theory "wikilink") that
claims Swift is [secretly gay](Closeted "wikilink"). A small faction of
Swifties, who call themselves "Gaylors", support and promote the theory,
believing that Swift hints at her [queerness](Queer "wikilink") through
her music and lifestyle, although she has stated she is "not part of"
the LGBT community but rather an [ally](Straight_ally "wikilink"). Some
Gaylors specifically [ship](Shipping_(fandom) "wikilink") Swift with
[Karlie Kloss](Karlie_Kloss "wikilink"), [Dianna
Agron](Dianna_Agron "wikilink"), or both, claiming Swift dated them in
the past, and accuse Swift of [queerbaiting](queerbaiting "wikilink") if
she is not gay. Most Swifties criticize Gaylor theories as far-fetched,
malicious, and disrespectful to Swift. Journalists likewise dismiss it
as an invasive and baseless conspiracy theory.<ref>Sources on Gaylor:
 Gaylors have alleged that a number of songs released by
    Swift confirm her romantic interest in women and that she was
    romantically involved with actresses [Emma
    Stone](Emma_Stone "wikilink") and [Cara
    Delevigne](Cara_Delevigne "wikilink") as well. They claimed that
    Swift's 2023 song "[When Emma Falls in
    Love](When_Emma_Falls_in_Love "wikilink")" is an acknowledgement of
    her relationship with Stone although Swift and Stone have only
    referred to each other as close friends in the media. However, the
    majority of Swifties consider the past relationship between Stone
    and actor [Andrew Garfield](Andrew_Garfield "wikilink") as the
    inspiration for the song. In the album prologue to *[1989
    (Taylor's Version)](1989_(Taylor's_Version) "wikilink")*, Swift
    acknowledged that her female friendships have been sexualized like
    the [tabloid media](Tabloid_journalism "wikilink") coverage of her
    male acquaintances. A January 2024 opinion article by
    writer Anna Marks, published in *[The New York
    Times](The_New_York_Times "wikilink"),* speculated that Swift is a
    closeted queer person based on Marks' perceptions of Swift's lyrics
    and aesthetics, drawing criticism from Swifties and other readers.
    Subsequently, [CNN Business](CNN_Business "wikilink") reported that
    Swift's personnel found the article "invasive, untrue and
    inappropriate".

## Academic study

Swifties have been the subject of journalistic and academic interest,
studied for their [social capital](social_capital "wikilink"),
consumerist characteristics and [interpersonal
relationships](interpersonal_relationship "wikilink"). Their
"prolific content creation, digital savvy, organizing capacity, and
sometimes vicious online behaviors" are also subjects of study, as per
[Internet culture](Internet_culture "wikilink") researchers Cristina
López and Avneesh Chandra. Donovan distinguished "Taylor Swift
fans" from Swifties, opining that the latter are a subculture
characterized by [collective
effervescence](collective_effervescence "wikilink"), unlike other
fanbases. Some [linguists](linguists "wikilink") termed the Swifties'
fan-coded, lyrics-based language a "fanilect". A 2023 [network
map](Network_mapping "wikilink") published by López and Chandra divided
Swifties into six distinct factions based on online interactions and
topics of discussion. A 2024 qualitative study of Indonesian
Swifties claimed that the parasocial interaction with Swift and the
interactions between Swifties satiates the fans' "social media
gratifications for entertainment, social interactions, and
[information-seeking](Information_seeking "wikilink")." Various
universities also host fan clubs dedicated to Swift.
