# Vinegar syndrome

**Vinegar syndrome**, also known as **acetic acid syndrome**, is a
condition created by the [deacetylation](deacetylation "wikilink") of
[cellulose acetates](cellulose_acetate "wikilink") (usually [cellulose
diacetate](cellulose_diacetate "wikilink")) and [cellulose
triacetate](cellulose_triacetate "wikilink"). This deacetylation
produces [acetic acid](acetic_acid "wikilink"), giving off a vinegar
odor that gives the condition its name; as well, objects undergoing
vinegar syndrome often shrink, become
[brittle](embrittlement "wikilink"), and form crystals on their surface
due to the migration of [plasticizers](plasticizer "wikilink").
Vinegar syndrome widely affects [cellulose acetate
film](cellulose_acetate_film "wikilink") as used in photography. It
has also been observed to affect older [magnetic
tape](magnetic_tape "wikilink"), where cellulose acetate is used as a
base, as well as [polarizers](polarizer "wikilink") used in
[liquid-crystal display](liquid-crystal_display "wikilink") units and
everyday plastics such as containers and
[tableware](tableware "wikilink"). High temperatures and
fluctuations in relative humidity have been observed to accelerate the
process. The process is [autocatalytic](Autocatalysis "wikilink"),
and the damage done by vinegar syndrome is irreversible.

## History

The first instance of cellulose triacetate degradation was reported to
the [Eastman Kodak](Kodak "wikilink") Company within a decade of its
introduction in 1948. The first report came from the Government of
India, whose film materials were stored in hot, humid conditions. It was
followed by further reports of degradation from collections stored in
similar conditions. These observations resulted in continuing studies in
the [Kodak](Kodak "wikilink") laboratories during the 1960s. Film
degradation can only be delayed by storage in dry and cold conditions.
It was initially thought that storage under recommended conditions might
delay decay by 450 years, but some films are developing vinegar syndrome
after just 70 years of cold dry storage.

The film preservationist [Harold
Brown](Harold_Brown_(film_preservationist) "wikilink") is credited with
coining the phrase "vinegar syndrome".

## The progression of degradation

In acetate film, [acetyl](acetyl "wikilink") (CH<sub>3</sub>CO) groups
are attached to long molecular chains of
[cellulose](cellulose "wikilink"). With exposure to moisture, heat, or
acids, these acetyl groups break from their molecular bonds and acetic
acid is released. While the acid is initially released inside the
plastic, it gradually diffuses to the surface, causing a characteristic
vinegary smell.

The decay process follows this pattern:

-   Acetic acid is released during the initial acetate base
    deterioration, leading to the characteristic vinegar odor. This
    signal marks the progression of deterioration.
-   The plastic [film base](film_base "wikilink") becomes
    [brittle](brittleness "wikilink"). This occurs in the advanced
    stages of deterioration, weakening the film and causing it to
    shatter with the slightest tension. These physical changes happen
    because cellulose acetate consists of long chains of repeating
    units, or [polymers](polymer "wikilink"). When the acetic acid is
    released as these groups break off, the acidic environment helps to
    break the links between units, shortening the
    [polymer](polymer "wikilink") chains and leading to brittleness.
-   Shrinkage also occurs during this process. With the cellulose
    acetate polymer chains breaking into smaller pieces, and with their
    side groups splitting off, the plastic film begins to shrink. In
    advanced stages of deterioration, shrinkage can be as much as 10%.
    There have been some reports of film 35mm wide shrinking to almost
    17mm.
-   As the acetate base shrinks, the [gelatin](gelatin "wikilink")
    [emulsion](emulsion "wikilink") of the film does not shrink, because
    it is not undergoing deterioration. The emulsion and film base
    separate, causing [buckling](buckling "wikilink"), referred to by
    archivists as 'channelling.' [Sheet
    films](Sheet_film "wikilink") are often severely channelled in the
    later stages of degradation.
-   Crystalline deposits or liquid-filled bubbles appear on the
    emulsion. These are evidence of
    [plasticizers](plasticizers "wikilink"), additives to the plastic
    base, becoming incompatible with the film base and oozing out on the
    surface. This discharge of plasticizers is a sign of advanced
    degradation.
-   In some cases, pink or blue colors appear in some sheet films. This
    is caused by [antihalation](antihalation "wikilink") dyes, which are
    normally colorless and incorporated into the gelatin layer. When
    acetic acid is formed during deterioration, the acidic environment
    causes the dyes to return to their original pink or blue color.

## Testing

A testing product developed by the [Image Permanence
Institute](Image_Permanence_Institute "wikilink"), A-D, or
"acid-detection" indicator strips change color from blue through shades
of green to yellow with increasing exposure to acid. According to the
test User's Guide, they were "created to aid in the preservation of
collections of photographic film, including sheet and [roll
films](roll_film "wikilink"), cinema film, and microfilm. They provide a
nondestructive method of determining the extent of vinegar syndrome in
film collections." These tools can be used to determine the
extent of damage to a film collection and which steps should be taken to
prolong their usability.
