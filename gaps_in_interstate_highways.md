# List of gaps in Interstate Highways

There are gaps in the Interstate Highway system, where the roadway
carrying an Interstate shield does not conform to the
[standards](Interstate_Highway_standards "wikilink") set by the [Federal
Highway Administration](Federal_Highway_Administration "wikilink")
(FHWA), the body that sets the regulations for the [Interstate Highway
System](Interstate_Highway_System "wikilink"). For the most part, the
Interstate Highway System in the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") is a connected system, with most
freeways completed; however, some Interstates still have gaps. These
gaps can be due to unconnected segments of the same route or from
failure of the road to fully conform to Interstate standards by
including such characteristics as at-grade crossings, traffic lights,
undivided or narrow freeways, or movable bridges ([lift
bridges](vertical_lift_bridge "wikilink") and
[drawbridges](bascule_bridge "wikilink")).

## True gaps

True gaps are where multiple disjoint sections of road have the same
Interstate highway number and can reasonably be considered part of "one
highway" in theory, based on the directness of connections via other
highways, or based on future plans to fill in the gap in the Interstate,
or simply based on the shortness of the gap. The sections are either not
physically connected at all, or they are connected but the connection is
not signed as part of the highway. This list does not include different
highways that share the same number, such as the two different
[I-76s](Interstate_76_(disambiguation) "wikilink"),
[I-84s](Interstate_84_(disambiguation) "wikilink"),
[I-86s](Interstate_86_(disambiguation) "wikilink"),
[I-87s](Interstate_87_(disambiguation) "wikilink"), and
[I-88s](Interstate_88_(disambiguation) "wikilink"), which despite
appearances, were always intended as distinct highways and were never
intended as a contiguous route.

### Interstate 26

In North Carolina, [Interstate 26](Interstate_26 "wikilink") has a gap
from Forks of Ivy to Asheville at exit 4A of Interstate 240. This is
because not all of the parts in the gap were built to Interstate
standards. As of November 2023, [Interstate
26](Interstate_26_in_North_Carolina "wikilink") is designated as Future
I-26, [US 19](U.S._Route_19_in_North_Carolina "wikilink"), and [US
23](U.S._Route_23_in_North_Carolina "wikilink"). Construction on
building this gap to Interstate Standards was scheduled to start in
2022.

### Interstate 49

[Interstate 49](Interstate_49 "wikilink") (I-49) currently has three
sections: the original alignment from I-10 in
[Lafayette](Lafayette,_Louisiana "wikilink") to I-20 in
[Shreveport](Shreveport "wikilink"), one from
[I-220](Interstate_220_(Louisiana) "wikilink") near Shreveport to
[Texarkana](Texarkana,_Arkansas "wikilink"); and the third section from
I-40 near [Alma, Arkansas](Alma,_Arkansas "wikilink") to I-470/I-435
south of [Kansas City, Missouri](Kansas_City,_Missouri "wikilink"). A
bypass south of [Bella Vista,
Arkansas](Bella_Vista,_Arkansas "wikilink") was completed in 2021, and
existed initially as [Arkansas Highway
549](Arkansas_Highway_549 "wikilink"); the latter designation is now
used on a short section southeast of [Fort
Smith](Fort_Smith,_Arkansas "wikilink") that is several miles long. It
is planned to be connected to an interstate with a project to construct
a new roadway from Arkansas Highway 22 to Interstate 40 in Arkansas.
I-49 from Fort Smith to Texarkana is still unbuilt. These gaps are
expected to be eventually closed.

### Interstate 69

[I-69](Interstate_69 "wikilink") currently has several disconnected
sections: the original alignment travels from [Indianapolis,
Indiana](Indianapolis "wikilink"), to [Port Huron,
Michigan](Port_Huron,_Michigan "wikilink"). A second section exists from
near [Evansville, Indiana](Evansville,_Indiana "wikilink"), to
[Martinsville, Indiana](Martinsville,_Indiana "wikilink") south of
Indianapolis. In stages from 2011 to 2018, sections of the [Purchase
Parkway](Purchase_Parkway "wikilink"), [I-24](Interstate_24 "wikilink"),
the [Wendell H. Ford Western Kentucky
Parkway](Western_Kentucky_Parkway "wikilink"), and the [Pennyrile
Parkway](Pennyrile_Parkway "wikilink") from [Mayfield,
Kentucky](Mayfield,_Kentucky "wikilink"), to [Henderson,
Kentucky](Henderson,_Kentucky "wikilink"), became signed as I-69. On
October 2, 2006, a segment of I-69 opened in
[Tunica](Tunica_County,_Mississippi "wikilink") and
[DeSoto](DeSoto_County,_Mississippi "wikilink") counties in Mississippi;
this segment has since been continued (but is not signed) through
[Memphis, Tennessee](Memphis,_Tennessee "wikilink"), to an intersection
with [U.S. Highway 51](U.S._Route_51 "wikilink") on the north side.
Between 2012 and 2015, a portion of [U.S. Highway
59](U.S._Route_59 "wikilink") (US 59) between
[Rosenberg](Rosenberg,_Texas "wikilink") and [Cleveland,
Texas](Cleveland,_Texas "wikilink"), extending through
[Houston](Houston "wikilink"), became part of I-69. In South
Texas, I-69's route splits into three spurs to cities on the U.S.–Mexico
border, on which four segments are complete: a short segment of I-69E in
[Corpus Christi](Corpus_Christi,_Texas "wikilink") and another from
[Raymondville](Raymondville,_Texas "wikilink") to the border in
[Brownsville](Brownsville,_Texas "wikilink"); a short segment of I-69C
in [Edinburg](Edinburg,_Texas "wikilink") and
[McAllen](McAllen "wikilink"); and a very short segment of I-69W
adjacent to the border in [Laredo](Laredo,_Texas "wikilink").

As of 2021, projects to connect these segments are in varying stages of
development. Indiana is currently working to connect the Port
Huron–Indianapolis and Martinsville–Evansville sections by extending
I-69 north from Martinsville to the I-465 Indianapolis loop, with
construction planned to be complete in late 2024. Kentucky and
Indiana expect to begin construction of the eastern bypass of Henderson
and new [Ohio River](Ohio_River "wikilink") crossing, connecting the
Mayfield–Henderson and Martinsville–Evansville sections, in 2022.
Kentucky has plans to upgrade the remaining section of the Purchase
Parkway and work with Tennessee to reconstruct the current interchange
at the south end of the Purchase Parkway in [South Fulton,
Tennessee](South_Fulton,_Tennessee "wikilink") to provide a free-flow
connection to the existing U.S. 51 freeway to Union City, while
Tennessee finished I-69 bypass of [Union
City](Union_City,_Tennessee "wikilink"). It is currently designated
as SR 690. A further bypass of [Troy](Troy,_Tennessee "wikilink") is
proposed but not yet funded, which would complete a freeway-standard
route from [I-155](Interstate_155_(Missouri–Tennessee) "wikilink") in
[Dyersburg](Dyersburg,_Tennessee "wikilink") to Henderson. Tennessee has
deferred plans to complete the section between Dyersburg and Memphis to
close the gap until the South Fulton–Dyersburg section is completed.
The section from Memphis to Houston is the least developed; as of 2021,
Mississippi has no current plans to extend I-69 further south, and the
states of Louisiana and Arkansas have not funded construction of their
portion of the proposed route (via [El
Dorado](El_Dorado,_Arkansas "wikilink") and
[Shreveport](Shreveport "wikilink")) between Mississippi and Texas,
other than a two-lane southern bypass of [Monticello,
Arkansas](Monticello,_Arkansas "wikilink") designed to be incorporated
into I-69 at a later date. Texas has continued to fund projects to
upgrade U.S. 59, U.S. 77, U.S. 281, and other routes that would
eventually form parts of I-69 in South Texas and East Texas, including
the I-69W/C/E spurs.

### Interstate 74

[I-74](Interstate_74 "wikilink") currently has five sections, the
original segment heading northwest from [Cincinnati,
Ohio](Cincinnati "wikilink"), to [Davenport,
Iowa](Davenport,_Iowa "wikilink"); one from the
[Virginia](Virginia "wikilink")–[North
Carolina](North_Carolina "wikilink") line along
[I-77](Interstate_77 "wikilink") south and east to a point southeast of
[Mount Airy, North Carolina](Mount_Airy,_North_Carolina "wikilink"); one
traveling around [High Point](High_Point,_North_Carolina "wikilink")
connecting with [I-85](Interstate_85 "wikilink") and reaching
[I-73](Interstate_73 "wikilink"), where the two are concurrent until
Ellerbe; and from west of
[Laurinburg](Laurinburg,_North_Carolina "wikilink") to south of
[Lumberton, North Carolina](Lumberton,_North_Carolina "wikilink"), at
[I-95](Interstate_95 "wikilink"). [North
Carolina](North_Carolina "wikilink") is currently working on connecting
all its sections of I-74.

### Interstate 86

The eastern [I-86](Interstate_86_(Pennsylvania–New_York) "wikilink") has
had two sections since 2006. One travels for from
[I-90](Interstate_90 "wikilink") in [North East,
Pennsylvania](North_East_Township,_Erie_County,_Pennsylvania "wikilink")
(which is a town in the northwestern part of the state) to exit 61 in
[Waverly, New York](Waverly,_Tioga_County,_New_York "wikilink"). The
second section is a stretch outside of
[Binghamton](Binghamton,_New_York "wikilink") traveling from
[I-81](Interstate_81 "wikilink") in
[Kirkwood](Kirkwood,_New_York "wikilink") to exit 79 in
[Windsor](Windsor_(village),_New_York "wikilink"). The gap is signed as
[Future 86](Interstate_86_(Pennsylvania–New_York)#Future "wikilink").
I-86 will eventually travel from North East, Pennsylvania, to the [New
York State Thruway](New_York_State_Thruway "wikilink")
([I-87](Interstate_87_(New_York) "wikilink")) near [Harriman, New
York](Harriman,_New_York "wikilink"). All the designated sections and
gaps in New York are part of [New York State
Route&nbsp;17](New_York_State_Route&nbsp;17 "wikilink").

### Interstate 99

As of 2023, [I-99](Interstate_99 "wikilink") has two sections: one from
the Pennsylvania Turnpike to just south of
[I-80](Interstate_80 "wikilink"), concurrent with
[US 220](U.S._Route_220 "wikilink"), and one from the Pennsylvania–New
York state line north to
[I-86](Interstate_86_(Pennsylvania–New_York) "wikilink") in [Corning,
New York](Corning_(city),_New_York "wikilink"), concurrent with
[US 15](U.S._Route_15 "wikilink"). Much of the intervening route,
including the entire US 15 section between
[I-180](Interstate_180_(Pennsylvania) "wikilink") in
[Williamsport](Williamsport,_Pennsylvania "wikilink") and the New York
state line, has been constructed to freeway standards but as of yet is
not signed as part of I-99.

The signing of the intervening route as I-99 will be completed when the
route is upgraded to Interstate standards, connecting the two segments
of I-99.

## Freeway gaps

Freeway gaps occur where the Interstate is signed as a continuous route,
but part, if not all of it, is not up to
[freeway](controlled-access_highway "wikilink") standards. This includes
[drawbridges](drawbridge "wikilink") where traffic on the Interstate can
be stopped for vessels. This does not include facilities such as
[tollbooths](toll_road "wikilink"), toll plazas, agricultural inspection
stations, or [border stations](border_checkpoint "wikilink").

### At-grade intersections

#### Major at-grade intersections

In urban and heavily developed areas, Interstates may travel along
surface roads or have [at-grade
intersections](at-grade_intersection "wikilink") with stop signs or
traffic lights. This usually happens because the Interstate started
construction after the land was heavily developed and buildings such as
residences and businesses and other roads would have to be removed to
allow a freeway to pass through. Additionally, more developed land would
have to be cleared for space to build interchanges to connect the
Interstate and surface streets. This situation is extremely uncommon as
Interstates are usually built around cities or through them on pre- or
lightly developed land.

-   [I-516](Interstate_516 "wikilink") downgrades to an expressway as it
    heads toward its eastern terminus. The expressway features a
    frontage road right turn and an at-grade intersection with Mildred
    Street close to the terminus at Montgomery Street and Derenne Avenue
    ([SR 21](Georgia_State_Route_21 "wikilink")) in [Savannah,
    Georgia](Savannah,_Georgia "wikilink"). Mildred Street southbound is
    closed by concrete barriers.

-   [I-19](Interstate_19 "wikilink") between North West Street and its
    southern terminus at West Crawford Street at North Sonoita Avenue,
    in [Nogales, Arizona](Nogales,_Arizona "wikilink"), consists of
    surface streets with traffic lights. The signage of this segment is
    intended to help direct traffic entering from Mexico to the nearest
    interstate.

-   [Interstate 69E](Interstate_69E "wikilink") in [Brownsville,
    Texas](Brownsville,_Texas "wikilink") passes through an at-grade
    signalized intersection with University Avenue/East Boulevard, as
    well as a minor intersection with Courage Street, before passing
    through the [Brownsville – Veterans Port of
    Entry](Brownsville_–_Veterans_Port_of_Entry "wikilink") and crossing
    the [Veterans International
    Bridge](Veterans_International_Bridge_at_Los_Tomates "wikilink").

-   [I-70](Interstate_70_in_Pennsylvania "wikilink") uses part of [US
    30](U.S._Route_30_in_Pennsylvania "wikilink") along a surface road
    in [Breezewood, Pennsylvania](Breezewood,_Pennsylvania "wikilink").
    Traffic traveling eastbound on
    I-70/[I-76](Interstate_76_in_Pennsylvania "wikilink") must exit and
    travel a short distance on US 30 in order to continue south on I-70
    heading to [Hancock, Maryland](Hancock,_Maryland "wikilink"). (The
    routing is similar for traffic following I-70 in the opposite
    direction: traffic traveling north on I-70 must exit and travel a
    short distance on US 30 in order to continue west on I-70/I-76 or to
    enter the [Pennsylvania
    Turnpike](Pennsylvania_Turnpike "wikilink").) This is one of very
    few instances of [traffic lights](traffic_light "wikilink") on an
    Interstate. There was formerly a sign of a policeman pointing at
    drivers leaving the Pennsylvania Turnpike to enter US 30, saying,
    "You! Slow Down!" Local businesses have lobbied to keep the gap to
    avoid a perceived potential loss of business.

-   [I-676](Interstate_676 "wikilink") has a surface street section at
    the west end of the [Ben Franklin
    Bridge](Ben_Franklin_Bridge "wikilink") in [Philadelphia,
    Pennsylvania](Philadelphia "wikilink"), because of historically
    significant areas. Signage and the [Federal Highway
    Administration](Federal_Highway_Administration "wikilink") consider
    I-676 to use the surface streets; the [Pennsylvania Department of
    Transportation](Pennsylvania_Department_of_Transportation "wikilink")
    and the [New Jersey Department of
    Transportation](New_Jersey_Department_of_Transportation "wikilink")
    consider I-676 to be continuous across the [Ben Franklin
    Bridge](Ben_Franklin_Bridge "wikilink"), even though the bridge,
    built in 1926, is not up to Interstate standards. This does not
    specifically violate Interstate standards, however, as the two
    separated segments of I-676 are in different states.

-   [I-78](Interstate_78 "wikilink") travels along a [one-way
    pair](one-way_pair "wikilink") of surface streets, 12th Street and
    14th Street, in [Jersey City, New
    Jersey](Jersey_City,_New_Jersey "wikilink"), between the end of the
    [New Jersey Turnpike](New_Jersey_Turnpike "wikilink") Newark Bay
    Extension and the [Holland Tunnel](Holland_Tunnel "wikilink"), which
    leads into [New York City](New_York_City "wikilink"). Between the
    two aforementioned points are four signalized intersections.

-   [I-180](Interstate_180_(Wyoming) "wikilink") in [Cheyenne,
    Wyoming](Cheyenne,_Wyoming "wikilink") is an
    [expressway](Limited-access_road "wikilink") with no parts built to
    Interstate standard; the interchange with
    [I-80](Interstate_80_in_Wyoming "wikilink") is a simple [diamond
    interchange](diamond_interchange "wikilink") with two traffic lights
    on I-180.

-   [I-81](Interstate_81_in_New_York "wikilink") near [Alexandria, New
    York](Alexandria,_New_York "wikilink") before the [Thousand Islands
    Bridge](Thousand_Islands_Bridge "wikilink") across the [Saint
    Lawrence River](Saint_Lawrence_River "wikilink") has intersections
    with an off-ramp leading from
    [NY-12](New_York_State_Route_12 "wikilink") and a service road
    connecting from the bridge toll station to a police department while
    also intersecting NY-12.

-   [I-587](Interstate_587_(New_York) "wikilink") in [Kingston, New
    York](Kingston,_New_York "wikilink") has a [traffic
    circle](traffic_circle "wikilink") (with yield signs) at its
    northern terminus with the ramps leading to/from
    [I-87](Interstate_87_(New_York) "wikilink").

#### Minor at-grade intersections

Several Interstates in rural areas of the U.S. have minor [at-grade
intersections](at-grade_intersection "wikilink") (including median
breaks) with farm access roads or authorized vehicle-only driveways used
for highway maintenance or connection to nearby utility stations. This
is usually due to the lack of an old highway, the need to provide access
to property that was accessed via the road prior to its upgrade to an
Interstate, and the high cost to construct an interchange for the small
amount of traffic that would use such a connection or to build a
[frontage road](frontage_road "wikilink") parallel to the freeway to the
nearest interchange.

-   [I-10](Interstate_10 "wikilink") in [Hudspeth County,
    Texas](Hudspeth_County,_Texas "wikilink") has at least fifteen
    at-grade intersections containing median breaks with minor dirt or
    gravel roads.
-   [I-11](Interstate_11 "wikilink") in [Boulder City,
    Nevada](Boulder_City,_Nevada "wikilink") has an at-grade
    intersection with an authorized-vehicle-only service road giving
    access to Buchanan Boulevard and the
    [WAPA](Western_Area_Power_Administration "wikilink") [Mead
    substation](Mead_substation "wikilink"). An interchange replacing
    this has been considered.
-   [I-15](Interstate_15_in_California "wikilink") in Wheaton Springs,
    California (east of [Mountain
    Pass](Mountain_Pass,_California "wikilink")) has several at-grade
    intersections with dirt roads, including one leading to a house.
-   [I-15](Interstate_15_in_Nevada "wikilink") west of [Mesquite,
    Nevada](Mesquite,_Nevada "wikilink") has an at-grade intersection
    with [Toquop Wash Road](Toquop_Wash "wikilink"), a dirt road.
    Another access point to Toquop Wash Road passes under the I-15
    southbound lanes and connects to the northbound lanes in the median.
-   [I-15](Interstate_15_in_Utah "wikilink") southbound near [Cove Fort,
    Utah](Cove_Fort,_Utah "wikilink") has an at-grade intersection with
    Cinder Crater Road, an asphalt and gravel road that provides access
    for trucks to the [Cinder Crater](Cinder_Crater "wikilink") quarry.
-   [I-520](Interstate_520 "wikilink") in [Augusta,
    Georgia](Augusta,_Georgia "wikilink") has an at-grade intersection
    with a gravel and asphalt road that provides access to Lovers Lane.
-   [I-40](Interstate_40_in_North_Carolina "wikilink") in the mountains
    of western [North Carolina](North_Carolina "wikilink") has at-grade
    access to several dirt roads, as well as a partially grade-separated
    interchange that lacks ramps or
    [RIROs](Right-in/right-out "wikilink") where roads directly connect
    to the I-40 carriageways.
    ([Example](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.7233304,-83.0266184,3a,75y,18.35h,62.02t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sdi-oSzoIXAt35WcCbEG37A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192))
-   [I-40](Interstate_40_in_Texas "wikilink") in western
    [Texas](Texas "wikilink") has eight at-grade access points for
    cattle ranches with median breaks.
-   [I-80](Interstate_80_in_Utah "wikilink") westbound in western
    [Utah](Utah "wikilink") in the [Great Salt Lake
    Desert](Great_Salt_Lake_Desert "wikilink") has two gravel roads that
    directly connect to the freeway, one accessing the *[Metaphor: The
    Tree of Utah](Metaphor:_The_Tree_of_Utah "wikilink")* artwork and
    another towards [Cobb Peak](Cobb_Peak_(Utah) "wikilink").
-   [I-80](Interstate_80_in_New_Jersey "wikilink") westbound in
    northwestern [New Jersey](New_Jersey "wikilink") has a RIRO
    providing access to Hainesburg Road at mile marker 3.4.
-   [I-94](Interstate_94_in_Michigan "wikilink") at [Fort
    Custer](Fort_Custer_Training_Center "wikilink") west of [Battle
    Creek, Michigan](Battle_Creek,_Michigan "wikilink") is the only
    instance of an Interstate freeway in Michigan to have a gated
    driveway (at 44th Street), which facilitates access of [military
    vehicles](military_vehicle "wikilink").

#### Other at-grade intersections

-   The northbound lanes of [I-5](Interstate_5_in_Washington "wikilink")
    in Washington intersect with an at-level
    [crosswalk](Pedestrian_crossing "wikilink") approximately south of
    the [border with Canada](Canada–United_States_border "wikilink").
    This crosswalk allows pedestrians access to a monument that is part
    of [Peace Arch Park](Peace_Arch_Park "wikilink").

### Undivided and narrow freeways

This section addresses [two-lane freeways](two-lane_freeway "wikilink")
and other narrow or undivided freeway sections of the Interstate,
excepting instances of continuing routes using one-lane ramps and merge
leads. Narrow gaps between opposing directions with jersey barriers
taller than four feet (1.2 m) are excluded from this section; therefore
the separation criterion is really either a 4-foot-tall (1.2 m) wall, 
or a 100-foot-wide (30 m) median, whichever is greater.

-   [I-40](Interstate_40_in_North_Carolina "wikilink")'s western 15 miles 
    (24 km) in
    [North Carolina](North_Carolina "wikilink") in the [Harmon Den
    Wildlife Management
    Area](Harmon_Den_Wildlife_Management_Area "wikilink") has several
    S-curves, a Jersey barrier with extremely narrow left shoulders and
    a few at-grade intersections albeit in [RIRO
    style](RIRO_expressway "wikilink").
-   [I-55](Interstate_55_in_Tennessee "wikilink") enters Tennessee from
    Arkansas on the [Memphis and Arkansas
    Bridge](Memphis_and_Arkansas_Bridge "wikilink"), which itself merits
    mention as a narrow through truss bridge. Just east of the bridge
    I-55 transitions from its east–west river crossing to the
    north–south alignment heading toward [Jackson,
    Mississippi](Jackson,_Mississippi "wikilink"). There is an
    interchange that forces through I-55 traffic to enter and exit in an
    old cloverleaf; in 2015 improvements were announced but are stalled.
    The improvements to the I-55 / Crump Boulevard interchange will be
    accomplished by constructing new through travel lanes for mainline
    I-55 traffic, which will eliminate the requirement for interstate
    traffic to use single-lane, low-speed ramps in order to continue on
    I-55. A new multi-lane roundabout intersection will be constructed
    to replace the existing cloverleaf interchange and provide improved
    access to and from I-55 and existing local roadways.
-   [I-555](Interstate_555 "wikilink") at its southern terminus through
    the I-55/[U.S. 61](U.S._Route_61 "wikilink")/[AR
    77](Arkansas_Highway_77 "wikilink") interchange becomes a two-lane
    undivided highway for 0.34 mi (0.55 km).
-   [Interstate 70](Interstate_70 "wikilink") is one-lane only in these
    following locations:
    -   [Interstate 70 in Kansas](Interstate_70_in_Kansas "wikilink")
        has only one lane for eastbound through traffic for several
        hundred feet in [Kansas City](Kansas_City,_Kansas "wikilink")
        where the highway approaches the [Lewis and Clark Viaduct
        Bridge](Intercity_Viaduct "wikilink"), which carries the highway
        over the [Kansas River](Kansas_River "wikilink") toward [Kansas
        City, Missouri](Kansas_City,_Missouri "wikilink"). [Interstate
        670](Interstate_670_(Kansas–Missouri) "wikilink"), just a few
        blocks south provides an alternate route without this
        bottleneck.
    -   [Interstate 70 in West
        Virginia](Interstate_70_in_West_Virginia "wikilink") has only
        one lane for approximately one thousand feet in
        [Wheeling](Wheeling,_West_Virginia "wikilink"), where the
        highway enters the [Wheeling Tunnel](Wheeling_Tunnel "wikilink")
        and crosses the [Ohio River](Ohio_River "wikilink") on the [Fort
        Henry Bridge](Fort_Henry_Bridge "wikilink"). Nearby
        [I-470](Interstate_470_(Ohio-West_Virginia) "wikilink") provides
        relief from this situation.
-   The [Mackinac Bridge](Mackinac_Bridge "wikilink"), which carries
    [I-75](Interstate_75_in_Michigan "wikilink") over the [Straits of
    Mackinac](Straits_of_Mackinac "wikilink") between [St.
    Ignace](St._Ignace,_Michigan "wikilink") and [Mackinaw
    City](Mackinaw_City,_Michigan "wikilink"), Michigan, has no wide
    median or hard shoulders due to space constraints. Nor does it have
    a [Jersey barrier](Jersey_barrier "wikilink"); instead, it has
    either a 4-inch-tall (10 cm) yellow divider between the opposing 
    directions (where the
    inner lanes are a metal grate) or a flat double-yellow line (where
    the inner lanes are paved). The speed limit is also reduced to 45 mph 
    (70 km/h) for cars and 20 mph (30 km/h) for trucks. The highway 
    returns to Interstate standard for
    about 50 miles until it reaches the [Sault Ste. Marie International
    Bridge](Sault_Ste._Marie_International_Bridge "wikilink"), which
    carries undivided lanes to the [Canada–US
    border](Canada–United_States_border "wikilink") in the middle of the
    bridge, where I-75 terminates.
-   The [Thousand Islands Bridge](Thousand_Islands_Bridge "wikilink"),
    which carries [I-81](Interstate_81_in_New_York "wikilink") over part
    of the [Saint Lawrence River](Saint_Lawrence_River "wikilink"), is
    an undivided two-lane road.
-   [I-93](Interstate_93_in_New_Hampshire "wikilink") is a two-lane
    divided parkway, or a "[super two](super_two "wikilink")", through
    [Franconia Notch](Franconia_Notch "wikilink") in [New
    Hampshire](New_Hampshire "wikilink"). A four-lane Interstate Highway
    was once proposed here, but the concept was abandoned because of
    environmental concerns, in part because of vibrations that could
    harm the [Old Man of the
    Mountain](Old_Man_of_the_Mountain "wikilink") rock formation (which
    collapsed in 2003 regardless). This section of highway was for many
    years marked as [US 3](U.S._Route_3_in_New_Hampshire "wikilink") and
    "To I-93", but these have now been replaced with regular I-93 signs.
    The Federal Highway Act of 1973 exempts this 7.6-mile (12.2 km) 
    stretch from the
    Interstate Highway standards that apply elsewhere, and this highway
    is considered to be I-93 for all practical purposes. This
    section of I-93 in New Hampshire is now the only remaining
    multi-mile section of two-lane freeway on an Interstate Highway in
    the United States. In addition, parking along portions of I-93
    through Franconia Notch was permitted until early 2019 when barriers
    and signage were posted due to safety concerns.
-   Some stretches of Interstate highway use a [barrier transfer
    machine](barrier_transfer_machine "wikilink") on some bridges to
    convert inner lanes from one direction to the other, where it would
    be too costly to upgrade/rebuild to a higher-capacity bridge. In any
    case the traffic distribution is strongly asymmetric depending on
    the hour of the day. This kind of bridge typically contains
    undivided lanes without the flexible Jersey barrier that is
    manipulated by machines.

### Movable bridges

By Interstate standard, all bridges on the Interstate system must be
fixed as to not interrupt the flow of traffic. Several bridges on the
system, however, are movable:
-   [I-5](Interstate_5 "wikilink") crosses the [Columbia
    River](Columbia_River "wikilink") from [Portland,
    Oregon](Portland,_Oregon "wikilink"), to [Vancouver,
    Washington](Vancouver,_Washington "wikilink"), on the [Interstate
    Bridge](Interstate_Bridge "wikilink"), a vertical-lift bridge. The
    [Columbia River Crossing](Columbia_River_Crossing "wikilink")
    project sought to replace this bridge until being abandoned in
    2013. However, in 2019, a new project was approved, scheduled to
    begin work in 2025.
-   [I-110](Interstate_110_(Mississippi) "wikilink") has a drawbridge
    across the Back Bay of Biloxi in [Biloxi,
    Mississippi](Biloxi,_Mississippi "wikilink").
-   [I-64](Interstate_64_in_Virginia "wikilink")—the [Hampton Roads
    Beltway](Hampton_Roads_Beltway "wikilink")—crosses the [South Branch
    Elizabeth River](South_Branch_Elizabeth_River "wikilink") in
    [Chesapeake, Virginia](Chesapeake,_Virginia "wikilink"), on the
    [High Rise Bridge](High_Rise_Bridge "wikilink"), which is a
    drawbridge, expected to be replaced by a larger fixed bridge. It
    opened in July 2022.
-   [I-264](Interstate_264_(Virginia) "wikilink") has a drawbridge, the
    [Berkley Bridge](Berkley_Bridge_(Virginia) "wikilink"), crossing the
    [Elizabeth River](Elizabeth_River_(Virginia) "wikilink") in
    [Norfolk, Virginia](Norfolk,_Virginia "wikilink").
-   [I-278](Interstate_278 "wikilink") has a drawbridge across the
    [Bronx River](Bronx_River "wikilink") in [New York
    City](New_York_City "wikilink").
-   [I-280](Interstate_280_(New_Jersey) "wikilink") has a [vertical-lift
    bridge](vertical-lift_bridge "wikilink"), the [Stickel Memorial
    Bridge](Stickel_Memorial_Bridge "wikilink"), crossing over the
    [Passaic River](Passaic_River "wikilink") between
    [Newark](Newark,_New_Jersey "wikilink") and [Harrison, New
    Jersey](Harrison,_New_Jersey "wikilink").
-   [I-95](Interstate_95_in_the_District_of_Columbia "wikilink")/[I-495](Interstate_495_(Capital_Beltway) "wikilink")
    pass together as the Capital Beltway over the [Potomac
    River](Potomac_River "wikilink") on the [Woodrow Wilson
    Bridge](Woodrow_Wilson_Bridge "wikilink"), a double-leaf bascule
    span. Even though the original bridge was replaced in the 2000s, the
    new bridge also has a draw span, albeit with more vertical clearance
    resulting in fewer openings than the old bridge—about 65 per year,
    an average of about one every six days.
-   [I-695](Interstate_695_(Maryland) "wikilink") has a drawbridge over
    [Curtis Creek](Curtis_Creek "wikilink"), south of
    [Baltimore](Baltimore "wikilink") and just west of the [Francis
    Scott Key Bridge](Francis_Scott_Key_Bridge_(Baltimore) "wikilink").
    This section of the Baltimore Beltway is not part of the Interstate
    Highway System, however, and is officially Maryland Route 695
    despite the Interstate signage on the highway.

### Freeway-to-freeway crosspaths without direct connection

-   [I-271](Interstate_271 "wikilink") in Ohio lacks a direct
    interchange with the I-80 section of the Ohio Turnpike; traffic
    interchanges between the two via
    [I-77](Interstate_77_in_Ohio "wikilink") and [Ohio State Route
    8](Ohio_State_Route_8 "wikilink"), which both pass nearby.
-   [I-475](Interstate_475_(Ohio) "wikilink") has no direct interchange
    with
    [I-80](Interstate_80_in_Ohio "wikilink")/[I-90](Interstate_90_in_Ohio "wikilink")
    on the [Ohio Turnpike](Ohio_Turnpike "wikilink") near Toledo.,
    though there is an indirect connection via [US
    20](U.S._Route_20_in_Ohio "wikilink") and Dussel Drive.
-   [I-476](Interstate_476 "wikilink") does not have a direct
    interchange with [I-78](Interstate_78_in_Pennsylvania "wikilink") in
    [Lehigh County,
    Pennsylvania](Lehigh_County,_Pennsylvania "wikilink"), though there
    is an indirect connection via [US
    22](U.S._Route_22_in_Pennsylvania "wikilink") and [PA
    309](PA_309 "wikilink"). Additionally, while it connects directly to
    [I-80](Interstate_80 "wikilink"), the freeway-grade is disrupted
    when the ramps intersect [PA
    940](Pennsylvania_Route_940 "wikilink").
-   [I-81](Interstate_81 "wikilink") connects to
    [I-76](Pennsylvania_Turnpike "wikilink") via [US
    11](U.S._Route_11 "wikilink") at-grade roads in [Carlisle,
    Pennsylvania](Carlisle,_Pennsylvania "wikilink").
-   The [Massachusetts Turnpike](Massachusetts_Turnpike "wikilink")
    ([I-90](Interstate_90 "wikilink")) passes over
    [I-391](Interstate_391 "wikilink") without interchange in [Chicopee,
    Massachusetts](Chicopee,_Massachusetts "wikilink"). The overpass is
    about one mile (1.6 km) north of the I-391 southern terminus at
    [I-91](Interstate_91 "wikilink"), and approximately 1.4 miles (2.3 km) 
    from the Mass
    Pike interchange with I-91 and [US 5](U.S._Route_5 "wikilink").
-   [I-95](Interstate_95_in_New_Jersey "wikilink") ([NJ Turnpike Pearl
    Harbor Memorial
    Extension](New_Jersey_Turnpike#Route_description#Extensions "wikilink"))
    passes under
    [I-295](Interstate_295_(Delaware–Pennsylvania) "wikilink") without
    interchange in [Columbus, New
    Jersey](Columbus,_New_Jersey "wikilink")
-   [I-195](Interstate_195_(Maryland) "wikilink") passes over
    [I-895](Interstate_895_(Maryland) "wikilink") without interchange
    near [Halethorpe, Maryland](Halethorpe,_Maryland "wikilink").
-   [I-295](Interstate_295_(Delaware–Pennsylvania) "wikilink") passes
    over [I-276](Pennsylvania_Turnpike "wikilink") without direct
    interchange in [Bristol Township,
    Pennsylvania](Bristol_Township,_Pennsylvania "wikilink"), though an
    interchange is under construction that will provide direct
    connection.
-   [I-99](Interstate_99 "wikilink") has connection gaps with both
    [I-70/I-76](Pennsylvania_Turnpike "wikilink") and
    [I-80](Interstate_80 "wikilink") in central Pennsylvania, both
    through at grade roads near
    [Bedford](Bedford,_Pennsylvania "wikilink") and [Bellefonte,
    Pennsylvania](Bellefonte,_Pennsylvania "wikilink"). The latter is
    expected to become freeway-grade as part of I-99's aforementioned
    northern extension.

#### Proposed

-   [I-422](Birmingham_Northern_Beltline "wikilink") (proposed) would
    have no direct freeway connection to its parent
    [I-22](Interstate_22 "wikilink"), though the two routes would cross
    near [Adamsville, Alabama](Adamsville,_Alabama "wikilink").

## Connection gaps

[Auxiliary
Interstates](List_of_auxiliary_Interstate_Highways "wikilink") (also
known as three-digit Interstates) are intended to connect to their
parent either directly or via a same-parented Interstate (like
[I-280](Interstate_280_(California) "wikilink") in California being
connected to [I-80](Interstate_80_in_California "wikilink") via
[I-680](Interstate_680_(California) "wikilink")). Often, these
connection gaps occur to eliminate concurrencies between other
three-digit routes. Freeway gaps (signed or
[unsigned](unsigned_highway "wikilink")) that officially connect
auxiliary routes to the parent are excluded.

### Current examples

-   [I-210](Interstate_210_and_State_Route_210_(California) "wikilink")
    in California does not currently connect directly to
    [I-10](Interstate_10_in_California "wikilink") or any of its spurs
    according to freeway signage. It was signed all the way to I-10
    until 1998, when [California State Route
    57](California_State_Route_57 "wikilink") replaced the portion of
    I-210 through [Covina](Covina,_California "wikilink") and [San
    Dimas](San_Dimas,_California "wikilink") to provide a proper
    connection to current State Route 210. The former portion of I-210
    now known as SR 57 still remains on the [Interstate Highway
    System](Interstate_Highway_System "wikilink") federally defined as
    Interstate 210 maintaining its connection to I-10, but it is not
    signed as per [Caltrans](Caltrans "wikilink") tradition to sign
    state highways by their state definition over their federal
    definition. State Route 210, built as an extension to replace Route
    30, connects to I-10 further east in
    [Redlands](Redlands,_California "wikilink"), and California is
    petitioning to have that portion signed as I-210 as well. When that
    happens, this gap will close.

-   [I-238](Interstate_238 "wikilink") does not have a parent. It was
    previously a part of [California State Route
    238](California_State_Route_238 "wikilink") that was built to
    Interstate standards, and it was added to the Interstate system
    using the same number it had as a state highway. It was upgraded to
    be an auxiliary route of
    [I-80](Interstate_80_in_California "wikilink"), but no three-digit
    combinations were available at the time the route was designated an
    interstate. Additionally, the exit numbers continue the mileage from
    the state highway instead of starting over from 1.

-   Due to [Highway revolts](Highway_revolts "wikilink") in [New York
    state](New_York_(state) "wikilink") forcing the interstate to
    terminate prematurely, none of the spurs of
    [I-78](Interstate_78 "wikilink") in New York City
    ([I-278](Interstate_278 "wikilink"),
    [I-478](Interstate_478 "wikilink"),
    [I-678](Interstate_678 "wikilink"),
    [I-878](Interstate_878 "wikilink")) connect to the parent road I-78,
    nor is there any surface street with a state route designation with
    the same number that continues with a solid connection. I-78 was
    planned to extend southeast through New York City via the [Lower
    Manhattan Expressway](Lower_Manhattan_Expressway "wikilink"),
    [Williamsburg Bridge](Williamsburg_Bridge "wikilink") and [Bushwick
    Expressway](Bushwick_Expressway "wikilink"), then east along what is
    now I-878 and north along what is now
    [I-295](Interstate_295_(New_York) "wikilink"). I-78 would have then
    split into two branches (the current I-295 and
    [I-695](Interstate_695_(New_York) "wikilink")), which would have
    both terminated at
    [I-95](Interstate_95_in_New_York "wikilink").<ref>

-   I-95 is shown on the [Hutchinson River
    Parkway](Hutchinson_River_Parkway "wikilink") north of the [Bruckner
    Interchange](Bruckner_Interchange "wikilink"), but the [1955 "Yellow
    Book" map](:File:New_York,_New_York_1955_Yellow_Book.jpg "wikilink")
    shows the I-78 route on the [Bruckner
    Expressway](Bruckner_Expressway "wikilink").
    </ref>

     I-478 comes the closest, and would have intersected I-78 as
    part of the [Westway](Westway_(New_York) "wikilink") project;
    this project was later canceled. I-278, the only I-78 spur to
    leave New York City, was planned to extend northwest to I-78 at
    [Route 24](New_Jersey_Route_24 "wikilink").<ref>\*

-   </ref>

    Since all the spurs are interconnected, only one of them needs to be
    eventually connected to its parent route for all of them to conform
    to numbering standards.

-   [I-585](Interstate_585 "wikilink") in South Carolina currently does
    not connect directly to
    [I-85](Interstate_85_in_South_Carolina "wikilink"). Until 1995, I-85
    was routed along present-day [I-85
    Business](Interstate_85_Business_(Spartanburg,_South_Carolina) "wikilink").
    In that year, I-85 was moved to the north to bypass Spartanburg
    while I-85 Business took over its former route, leaving I-585
    without a connection to its parent route until upgrades to the
    existing [US 176](U.S._Route_176 "wikilink") highway are
    complete.

-   As of July 2022, [I-587](Interstate_587_(North_Carolina) "wikilink")
    in North Carolina does not connect with its parent route,
    [I-87](Interstate_87_(North_Carolina) "wikilink"). Upgrades to the
    existing [US 264](U.S._Route_264 "wikilink") freeway from [US
    64](U.S._Route_64_in_North_Carolina "wikilink") to
    [I-95](Interstate_95_in_North_Carolina "wikilink") to Interstate
    standards, as well as extending I-87 via upgrades to US 64, will
    connect I-587 with its parent route.

-   [I-335](Interstate_335_(Oklahoma) "wikilink") in Oklahoma will not
    have a connection with its parent route,
    [I-35](Interstate_35_in_Oklahoma "wikilink"), until an extension of
    the road to [Purcell](Purcell,_Oklahoma "wikilink") is built.

-   Numerous three-digit Interstate routes are unsigned on some portions,
    leading some to think there are connection gaps. These so-called
    connection gaps do not have internal unsigned concurrencies on other
    Interstate highway segments between the "parent route" and signed
    terminus.
