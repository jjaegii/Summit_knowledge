# Traffic law in the United States

For [driving in the United
States](driving_in_the_United_States "wikilink"), each state and
territory has its own [traffic code](traffic_code "wikilink") or **rules
of the road**, although most of the rules of the road are similar for
the purpose of uniformity, given that all states grant reciprocal
driving privileges (and
[penalties](Traffic_Violations_Reciprocity "wikilink")) to each other's
licensed drivers. There is also a "Uniform Vehicle Code" which was
proposed by a private, non-profit group, based upon input by its
members. The UVC was not adopted in its entirety by any state. As with
[uniform acts](uniform_act "wikilink") in general, some states adopted
selected sections as written or with modifications, while others created
their own *[sui generis](sui_generis "wikilink")* statutes touching upon
the same subject matter. As required by the federal Highway Safety Act
of 1966, all states and territories have adopted substantially similar
standards for the vast majority of [signs](Traffic_sign "wikilink"),
[signals](Traffic_signal "wikilink"), and [road surface
markings](road_surface_marking "wikilink"), based upon the [Manual on
Uniform Traffic Control
Devices](Manual_on_Uniform_Traffic_Control_Devices "wikilink") from the
U.S. Department of Transportation. Many of the standard rules of the
road involve consistent interpretation of the standard signs, signals,
and markings such as what to do when approaching a stop sign, or the
driving requirements imposed by a [double yellow
line](double_yellow_line "wikilink") on the street or highway. In order
to implement their own traffic laws on the property of their own
facilities (such as national parks and military posts), several federal
agencies have also developed their own traffic laws.

List of some standard rules of the road:

-   Entering and leaving roadways.
-   [Right of way](Traffic#Right_of_way "wikilink") at marked and
    unmarked [intersections](intersection_(road) "wikilink") under
    various conditions.
-   Observing and interpreting [traffic signs](traffic_sign "wikilink")
    (especially [warning](warning_signs "wikilink"),
    [priority](priority_signs "wikilink") or [prohibitory traffic
    signs](prohibitory_traffic_sign "wikilink"))
-   Keeping to right side (or left side) except to pass others, where
    passing is allowed.
-   Direction of travel and turning (one way, do not enter, no
    [U-turn](U-turn_(maneuver) "wikilink"), etc.)
-   Speed, height, width and weight limits.
-   Bicycle and pedestrian priority.
-   Yielding to special vehicles (emergency, funeral, school bus).
-   Vehicle [lighting](lighting "wikilink") and
    [signalling](traffic_signal "wikilink").
-   Stopping if there has been a [collision](collision "wikilink").

Georgiaâ€™s new law which took effect from July 1, 2018, prohibits the
drivers from holding any devices ([Mobile
phones](Mobile_phone "wikilink") or any [electronic
devices](electronic_devices "wikilink")) in hand while driving. 

Traffic is required to keep to the right, known as a [right-hand
traffic](Left-_and_right-hand_traffic "wikilink") pattern. The exception
is the [US Virgin Islands](US_Virgin_Islands "wikilink"), where people
drive on the left.

Most states in the United States enforce [priority to the
right](priority_to_the_right "wikilink") at uncontrolled intersections,
where motorists must yield to the right.

The two most important differences between U.S. traffic rules and
foreign countries' traffic rules are as follows:

-   Very heavy use of fully-signed, mandatory 4-way stop signs at
    intersections (rather than 2-way stops, yields, or roundabouts as in
    other countries) with priority to the first vehicle (priority to the
    right if two arrive at the exact same time)
-   Traffic lights are normally positioned after the intersection, on
    the far side from approaching traffic, rather than before

### Speed limits

[Speed limits](Speed_limits "wikilink") are set by each state or
territory, as well as counties or municipalities, on the roads within
their jurisdiction. The maximum speed limit on rural two-lane roads
ranges from 50 mph (80 km/h) in parts of the northeast to 75 mph
(120 km/h) in parts of [Texas](Texas "wikilink"). On rural [Interstate
Highways](Interstate_Highway_System "wikilink") and other
[freeways](Controlled-access_highway "wikilink"), the speed limit ranges
from 60 mph (96 km/h) in Hawaii to 85 mph (136 km/h) in parts of
[Texas](Texas "wikilink"). All roads in the United States have a speed
limit, but it is not always posted (especially in rural areas).

### Lane discipline and overtaking

[Overtaking](Overtaking "wikilink"), usually called "passing", is legal
on all four or more lane roads and on most two-lane roads with
sufficient sight distance. On two-lane roads, one must pass to the left
of the overtaken vehicle unless that vehicle is preparing to make a left
turn, in which case the vehicle must be passed on the right. Passing on
the left means that the overtaking vehicle must enter the oncoming lane.
This should only be done in a legal passing zone, designated by either a
dashed yellow center-line (indicating that passing is legal in both
directions) or a solid line paired with a dashed line (indicating that
passing is only legal for traffic adjacent to the broken line). A solid
double yellow line indicated that passing is illegal in both directions.
In some states, it is not against the law to overtake vehicles in the
presence of solid yellow lines if it is safe to do so. For example,
[Vermont](Vermont "wikilink") state law also allows passing across the
double yellow line when no traffic is on the opposing side; however, one
must pass quickly and return to the proper side. However, this is
unusual as most states have a ban on crossing a double yellow line
except when turning, or when pedestrians, bicycles, or other
obstructions in the road make it necessary. Overtaking another vehicle
across a solid yellow line is usually considered a serious traffic
violation in most states.

On roads with four or more lanes (including divided highways), vehicles
may pass to the left or to the right of slower vehicles as long as the
maneuver can be completed safely. However, most states either suggest or
require that through traffic stay to the right except to pass. The
[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices](Manual_on_Uniform_Traffic_Control_Devices "wikilink") includes
several signage standards to inform drivers of proper lane discipline,
including the "STAY RIGHT PASS LEFT" and "SLOWER TRAFFIC KEEP RIGHT"
signs.

### Seat belt use

49 states, the [District of Columbia](District_of_Columbia "wikilink")
and the five [inhabited
territories](Territories_of_the_United_States "wikilink") have passed
laws requiring seat belt use by at least all occupants of the front
seat. New Hampshire is the only state with no such requirement for
adults (anyone under eighteen must use a seat belt). Some states also
require rear seat occupants to wear seat belts. In 24 states, the seat
belt law is considered to be only a *secondary offense*, meaning that a
police officer can only ticket a person for violating the seat belt law
if the driver has already been stopped for another reason. The
effectiveness of seat belt laws varies considerably throughout the
country, with some areas observing over 95% usage and others with less
than 40% usage.

### Road signs

In the United States, [road signs](traffic_sign "wikilink") are, for the
most part, standardized by federal regulations, most notably in the
*[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices](Manual_on_Uniform_Traffic_Control_Devices "wikilink")* (MUTCD)
and its companion volume the *Standard Highway Signs* (SHS). Under a
federal regulation promulgated by the [Federal Highway
Administration](Federal_Highway_Administration "wikilink") pursuant to
the Highway Safety Act, states must remain in "substantial conformance"
with the MUTCD. This standard does not require states to precisely
conform to the MUTCD, which allows for a degree of local variation in
certain minor aspects of road signs and markings.

## Uniform Vehicle Code

The **Uniform Vehicle Code** (**UVC**) is a [model
act](model_act "wikilink") by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic
Laws and Ordinances, a private [non-profit
organization](Nonprofit_organization "wikilink"). Most of the members
are [state
governments](State_governments_of_the_United_States "wikilink"), in
addition to some related organizations. The extent to which the code is
used varies by each [state](U.S._states "wikilink"),
[territory](Territories_of_the_United_States "wikilink"), and [Native
American tribe](Tribe_(Native_American) "wikilink"). It was last updated
in 2000.

Although the UVC was broadly influential, virtually all American
jurisdictions extensively rearranged, renumbered, and rewrote various
UVC sections in the process of enacting them. One example of the
resulting complexity is that in 1979, the NCUTLO needed 262 pages just
to explain all state-by-state variations of each section of UVC Chapter
11, Rules of the Road.

Some time not long after the release of the 2000 edition, " \[the\]
NCUTLO went into hiatus because of a lack of funding. The primary
problem was that the Internet provided, at no cost, much of the
information that was previously easily available only from the committee
for the cost of an annual membership." It has since ceased
operations. In the absence of NCUTLO, the [NCUTCD](NCUTCD "wikilink")
(the NCUTLO's counterpart in the development of the [Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control
Devices](Manual_on_Uniform_Traffic_Control_Devices "wikilink")) has
appointed a task force to review potentially outdated portions of the
most recent edition of the UVC, and to propose updated language. The
last update was issued in 2015.

## International standards

The United States was one of the original signatories on September 19,
1949, to the [Geneva Convention on Road
Traffic](Geneva_Convention_on_Road_Traffic "wikilink"), which came into
effect in the United States on August 30, 1950. However, the United
States has not signed or ratified subsequent treaties like the [Vienna
Convention on Road
Traffic](Vienna_Convention_on_Road_Traffic "wikilink").
