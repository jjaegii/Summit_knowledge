# Coachella 2023

**Coachella 2023** was a music festival that took place over two
weekends in mid-April 2023. The 22nd [Coachella Valley Music and Arts
Festival](Coachella_Valley_Music_and_Arts_Festival "wikilink"),
Coachella 2023 was held at the [Empire Polo
Club](Empire_Polo_Club "wikilink") in [Indio,
California](Indio,_California "wikilink"). The festival was headlined by
Puerto Rican rapper [Bad Bunny](Bad_Bunny "wikilink"), South Korean girl
group [Blackpink](Blackpink "wikilink"), American singer [Frank
Ocean](Frank_Ocean "wikilink"), and American
[rock](Rock_music "wikilink") band [Blink-182](Blink-182 "wikilink").

## Background

The dates for Coachella were announced on June 14, 2022, with pre-sale
tickets going live on June 17.

### Performance by Frank Ocean

On the final night of Weekend 1 of Coachella, there was uncertainty over
whether headliner Frank Ocean would show up to the event. Despite his
exclusion from the official YouTube livestream, Ocean began performing
at 10:55 p.m., an hour later than his initial booking. He performed for
an hour and a half, performing a rock version of his debut single
"[Novacane](Novacane_(song) "wikilink")" (2011) that references
Coachella, as well as reworked versions of several of his songs, such as
"Bad Religion" off of *[Channel Orange](Channel_Orange "wikilink")*
(2012) and "White Ferrari" off of
*[Blonde](Blonde_(Frank_Ocean_album) "wikilink")* (2016). He then
explained that his appearance was in honor of Ryan Breaux, his younger
brother who died in a car crash in 2020. Ocean abruptly ended his
performance with a cover of [The Isley
Brothers](The_Isley_Brothers "wikilink")' "[At Your Best (You Are
Love)](At_Your_Best_(You_Are_Love) "wikilink")" (1976), once covered by
[Aaliyah](Aaliyah "wikilink"), informing the audience that it was
[curfew](curfew "wikilink"). The performance was done through large
video screens; the screens obscured Ocean and his band and were poorly
lit. During the middle of the set, a DJ—later revealed to be DJ
Crystallmess began playing, leading many fans to believe the show had
concluded, before Ocean introduced her 15 minutes later, teasing Ocean's
radio show Homer Radio.

Ocean's Coachella performance was harshly criticized from audience
members, critics, and fans. *The Festive Owl*, speaking to several
sources, later stated that a group of people surrounding Ocean were
intended to be ice skaters and had practiced for weeks. As Coachella set
up the stage, Ocean ultimately decided that he wasn't a fan of the ice
skaters, leaving the festival with no option but to deconstruct the ice
rink—which had been planned for months—threatening to not perform if it
was not done. Melting the ice rink caused the one hour delay in his
performance. Additionally, Ocean's performance needed to be adjusted as
he sustained an ankle injury during rehearsals that week, according to
*[Rolling Stone](Rolling_Stone_(magazine) "wikilink")*.
[TMZ](TMZ "wikilink") added that the injury occurred while he was riding
bicycles artists and staff use to navigate the festival, and was
reportedly serious enough that Ocean's doctors advised Coachella to
change his production. Ocean announced that he had pulled out of
Coachella on April 19 due to his injury, leaving
[Blink-182](Blink-182 "wikilink") and later
[Skrillex](Skrillex "wikilink"), [Four Tet](Four_Tet "wikilink"), &
[Fred again..](Fred_again.. "wikilink") to headline Weekend 2.

## Lineup

The lineup for Coachella was announced on January 10, 2023. For the
first time since the festival began in 1999, all three headliners—[Bad
Bunny](Bad_Bunny "wikilink"), [Blackpink](Blackpink "wikilink"), and
[Frank Ocean](Frank_Ocean "wikilink")—were not Caucasian, with Blackpink
being the first Korean headliners. Following Ocean's departure,
[Blink-182](Blink-182 "wikilink"), as well as
[Skrillex](Skrillex "wikilink"), [Four Tet](Four_Tet "wikilink"), and
[Fred again..](Fred_again.. "wikilink"), headlined Weekend 2.
Coachella 2023 also featured acts fully sung in
[Arabic](Arabic "wikilink") and [Punjabi](Punjabi_language "wikilink")
artist [Diljit Dosanjh](Diljit_Dosanjh "wikilink") from India for the
first time; these initiatives were part of a greater effort by
[Goldenvoice](Goldenvoice "wikilink")—the organizers of Coachella—to
feature more diverse artists.

For the first time since 2019, Coachella 2023 hosted the Heineken House,
a small venue sponsored by Dutch brewing company [Heineken
N.V.](Heineken_N.V. "wikilink"), featuring American hip hop duo [Method
Man & Redman](Method_Man_&_Redman "wikilink").
