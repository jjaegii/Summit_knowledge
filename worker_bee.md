# Worker bee

A **worker bee** is any female bee
that lacks the reproductive capacity of the colony's [queen
bee](queen_bee "wikilink") and carries out the majority of tasks needed
for the functioning of the hive. While worker bees are present in all
[eusocial](Eusociality "wikilink") bee species, the term is rarely used
(outside of scientific literature) for bees other than [honey
bees](Honey_bee "wikilink"), particularly the European honey bee (*Apis
mellifera*). Worker bees of this variety are responsible for
approximately 80% of the world's crop pollination services.[1]

Worker bees are the caste of bee that perform most of the fundamental
tasks of the hive, and they are by far the most numerous type of bee.[2]
They are much smaller than [drones](Drone_(bee) "wikilink") or
[queen](Queen_bee "wikilink") bees, with bodies specialized for nectar
and pollen collection. They perform different tasks around the hive
progressively over their lifespans in a predictable order based on their
age.[3]

Worker bees gather pollen in the [pollen
baskets](Pollen_basket "wikilink") on their back legs and carry it back
to the hive where it is used as food for the developing
[brood.](Brood_(honeybee) "wikilink") Pollen carried on their bodies may
be transferred to another flower, where a small portion can rub off on
the [pistil](pistil "wikilink"), resulting in cross
[pollination](pollination "wikilink"). [Nectar](Nectar "wikilink") is
sucked up through the proboscis, mixed with [enzymes](Enzyme "wikilink")
in the stomach, and carried back to the hive, where it is stored in wax
cells and evaporated into [honey](honey "wikilink").[4]

## Life cycle

Honey bee workers maintain the hive temperature in the critical brood
area where new bees are hatched and raised. Workers must maintain the
hive's brood chamber within a range of 34-36 °C (93.2-96.8 °F). If the
chamber becomes too hot, the workers collect water or diluted nectar and
deposit it around the hive, then fan the air with their wings to
generate cooling by evaporation. If the chamber becomes too cold, worker
bees can increase the temperature of their thoracic muscles using
[isometric contractions](Isometric_exercise "wikilink"), pressing their
warmed muscles against caps or walls of brood cells.[5] In the
wintertime, worker bees can [cluster
together](Winter_cluster "wikilink") to generate body heat to keep the
brood area warm as external temperature decreases.[6]

The life span of a worker bee fluctuates between the summer and winter
months. In the summertime, worker bees typically only live two to six
weeks compared to wintertime when workers can live up to 20 weeks. The
reason for this difference lies in interior physiological processes that
worker bees experience, and external factors, such as bees not leaving
the relative safety of the hive during the colder winter months. Worker
bees are exposed to a lot more risks during the summer months when they
leave the hive to forage, and therefore have a shorter relative
lifespan.[7]

Honey bees begin as an egg laid by the queen in the brood nest, located
near the center of the hive. Worker eggs are laid in smaller cells
compared to drone eggs, and will hatch after three days into a larva.
Nurse bees feed it [royal jelly](royal_jelly "wikilink") for three
days,[8] followed by pollen and honey for about two more days until the
cell is capped by worker bees. The larva spins itself into a cocoon and
becomes an inactive pupa. During this 10-day stage, the bee begins to
develop features such as eyes, wings, legs and other features that adult
bees possess. After this 21 day developmental period, the adult bee will
chew through its wax cap and cocoon and emerge into the hive as a fully
grown bee, immediately beginning its roles in the hive.[9]

## Progression of tasks

Through the lifecycle of a worker bee, she will take on many different
roles within the hive, depending on how old she is and how long she has
been working in the hive. The exact number of days she spends at each
task depends on the requirements of the hive, however there is an
estimated number of days each worker bee will spend at each task. [10]

### Cell cleaning (days 1–2)

Brood cells must be cleaned before the next use. Worker bees in the
cleaning phase perform this cleaning. Cells are inspected by the queen
and if unsatisfactory, they will not be used. If the cells are not
clean, the worker bee must repeat the cleaning process.

### Nurse bees (days 3–12)

Nurse bees feed the worker larvae worker jelly, which is secreted from
glands that produce royal jelly. On days 6-12, nurse bees feed [royal
jelly](royal_jelly "wikilink"), rich in vitamins, to the queen larva and
drones. [Drones](Drone_(bee) "wikilink") receive worker jelly for 1 to 3
days until they are started on a diet of honey.

### Queen attendants (days 7-11)

Queen attendants take care of the queen by feeding and grooming her.
After coming into contact with the queen, the attendants spread [queen
mandibular pheromone](queen_mandibular_pheromone "wikilink") (QMP)
throughout the hive, which is a signal to the rest of the bees that the
hive still has a viable queen.

### Wax production (days 13–18)

Wax bees build cells from wax, repair old cells, and store nectar and
pollen brought in by other workers. Early in the worker's career, she
exudes wax from the space between her abdominal segments. Four sets of
wax glands, situated inside the last four ventral segments of the
abdomen, produce wax for comb construction.

### Foraging bees (days 21–42)

The [forager](Forage_(honey_bee) "wikilink") and scout bees travel up to
3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to a [nectar source](nectar_source "wikilink"),
[pollen source](pollen_source "wikilink"), or to collect
[propolis](propolis "wikilink") or water. Worker bees journey away from
the hive around 10 times each day, with each trip lasting an hour.[11]

## Worker activities in the hive

### Honey production

Worker bees collect nectar from flowers using their tubular mouth parts,
and store it in their honey stomach. Enzymes proceed to break down the
nectar into simple sugars. Back at the hive, the nectar is distributed
to other worker bees who either distribute it to young bees or store it
in honeycomb cells. Then, [honey](honey "wikilink") is produced by being
further dehydrated via fanning then sealed with a wax cap, which
prevents absorption of moisture from the air.[12]

### Drone feeding

Drones do not feed themselves when they are young; they are fed by
workers and then when the [drone bees](Drone_(bee) "wikilink") get older
they feed themselves from the honey supply. [13]

### Honeycomb building

Worker bees have eight pairs of wax glands under their abdomen from
which they can create honeycomb. By chewing the wax, she mixes in her
saliva, which adjusts the malleability of the wax and enables her to
create each individual honeycomb cell. This process is repeated
thousands of times to create comb in the hive, which will be used for
honey production and brood space.[14]

### Pollen packing

Pollen brought into the hive for feeding the brood is also stored. It
must be packed firmly into comb cells and mixed with a small amount of
honey so that it will not spoil. Unlike honey, which does not support
bacterial life, stored pollen will become
[rancid](Rancidification "wikilink") without proper care. It has to be
kept in honey cells.[15]

### Propolizing

The walls of the hive are covered with a thin coating of
[propolis](propolis "wikilink"), a resinous substance obtained from
plants. When workers add enzymes to the propolis, the combination has
antibacterial and antifungal properties. Propolis is placed at the
entrance of hives to aid in ventilation.

Some bees add excess mud to the mixture, making it geopropolis, such as
in the bee *[Melipona
scutellaris](Melipona_scutellaris "wikilink").*[16] Geopropolis displays
antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity and has been proven to be a
source of antibiofilm agents. It also presents selectivity against human
cancer cell lines at low concentrations compared to normal cells.[17]

### Mortuary bees

Dead bees and failed larvae must be removed from the hive to prevent
disease and allow cells to be reused. They will be carried some distance
from the hive by mortuary bees.[18]

### Fanning bees

Worker bees fan the hive, cooling it with evaporated water. They direct
airflow into the hive or out of the hive depending on need.[19]

### Water carriers

When the hive is in danger of overheating, these bees will obtain water,
usually from within a short distance from the hive and bring it back to
spread on the backs of fanning bees.[20]

### Guard bees

Guard bees will stand at the front of the hive entrance, defending it
from any invaders such as [wasps](wasp "wikilink"). The number of guards
varies from season to season and from species to species. Entrance size
and daily traffic also play an integral role in the number of guard bees
present. Guard bees of the species *[Tetragonisca
angustula](Tetragonisca_angustula "wikilink")* and *[Schwarziana
quadripunctata](Schwarziana_quadripunctata "wikilink")* are examples of
eusocial bees that have been observed hovering at their nest entrances,
providing more protection against intruders.[21][22]

## Genetic characteristics

In most common bee species, worker bees are infertile due to enforced
altruistic [kin selection](kin_selection "wikilink"),[23] and thus never
reproduce. Workers are nevertheless considered female for anatomical and
genetic reasons. Genetically, a worker bee does not differ from a queen
bee and can even become a [laying worker
bee](laying_worker_bee "wikilink"), but in most species will produce
only male (drone) offspring. Whether a larva becomes a worker or a queen
depends on the kind of food it is given after the first three days of
its larval form.

## Gut bacteria

The workers perform different behavioral tasks in the colony that cause
them to be exposed to different local environments. The worker gut
microbial community composition is found to be associated with the
behavioral tasks they perform, therefore also with the local environment
they are exposed to[24] and the environmental landscape is shown to
affect the gut microbial community (gut microbiota composition) of honey
bees.[25]

## Stinger

The worker bee's stinger is a complex organ that allows a bee to defend
itself and the hive from most mammals.[26] [Bee
stings](Bee_sting "wikilink") against mammals and birds typically leave
the stinger embedded in the victim due to the structure of flesh and the
stinger's barbs. In this case, the venom bulb stays with the stinger and
continues to pump. The bee will die after losing its stinger, as the
removal of the stinger and the venom bulb damages or removes other
internal organs as well.[27]

The [barbs](wikt:barb "wikilink") on the stinger will not catch on most
animals besides mammals and birds, which means that such animals can be
stung repeatedly by the same bee.

## Other social bees

There are many types of [eusocial](eusociality "wikilink") bees,
including [bumble bees](bumble_bee "wikilink"), [stingless
bees](stingless_bee "wikilink"), some [orchid
bees](orchid_bee "wikilink"), and many species of [sweat
bees](Halictidae "wikilink"), native to all continents except for
[Antarctica](Antarctica "wikilink"), that have workers. Workers in these
other bee lineages do not show significant morphological differences
from queens, other than coloration or a smaller average body size,
though they are often quite different in their behavior from queens, and
may or may not lay eggs. See the respective articles for these lineages
for details.[28]
