# Multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator

The **multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG)** 
is a type of [radioisotope thermoelectric
generator](radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator "wikilink") (RTG)
developed for [NASA](NASA "wikilink") space missions[1] such as the
[Mars Science Laboratory](Mars_Science_Laboratory "wikilink") (MSL),
under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Energy's
Office of Space and Defense Power Systems within the [Office of Nuclear
Energy](Office_of_Nuclear_Energy "wikilink"). The MMRTG was developed by
an industry team of [Aerojet Rocketdyne](Aerojet_Rocketdyne "wikilink")
and [Teledyne Energy Systems](Teledyne_Technologies "wikilink").

## Background

Space exploration missions require safe, reliable, long-lived power
systems to provide electricity and heat to spacecraft and their science
instruments. A uniquely capable source of power is the radioisotope
thermoelectric generator (RTG) – essentially a nuclear battery that
reliably converts heat into electricity.[2] Radioisotope power has been
used on eight Earth orbiting missions, eight missions to the outer
planets, and the [Apollo](Apollo_program "wikilink") missions after
[Apollo 11](Apollo_11 "wikilink") to the Moon. The outer Solar System
missions are the [*Pioneer 10* and *11*](Pioneer_program "wikilink"),
[*Voyager 1* and *2*](Voyager_program "wikilink"),
*[Ulysses](Ulysses_(spacecraft) "wikilink")*,
*[Galileo](Galileo_(spacecraft) "wikilink")*,
*[Cassini](Cassini–Huygens "wikilink")* and *[New
Horizons](New_Horizons "wikilink")* missions. The RTGs on *[Voyager
1](Voyager_1 "wikilink")* and *[Voyager 2](Voyager_2 "wikilink")* have
been operating since 1977.[3] In total, over the last four decades, 26
missions and 45 RTGs have been launched by the United States.

## Function

[Solid-state](semiconductor_device "wikilink")
[thermoelectric](thermoelectric_effect "wikilink") couples convert the
[heat](heat "wikilink") produced by the [natural
decay](radioactive_decay "wikilink") of the
[radioisotope](radioisotope "wikilink")
[plutonium-238](plutonium-238 "wikilink") to
[electricity](electricity "wikilink").[4] The physical conversion
principle is based on the [Seebeck effect](Seebeck_effect "wikilink"),
obeying one of the [Onsager reciprocal
relations](Onsager_reciprocal_relations "wikilink") between flows and
gradients in thermodynamic systems. A [temperature
gradient](temperature_gradient "wikilink") generates an
[electron](electron "wikilink") flow in the system. Unlike
[photovoltaic](Photovoltaics "wikilink") solar arrays, RTGs are not
dependent upon [solar energy](solar_energy "wikilink"), so they can be
used for deep space missions.

## History

In June 2003, the [Department of
Energy](United_States_Department_of_Energy "wikilink") (DOE) awarded the
MMRTG contract to a team led by Aerojet Rocketdyne. Aerojet Rocketdyne
and Teledyne Energy Systems collaborated on an MMRTG design concept
based on a previous thermoelectric converter design,
[SNAP-19](SNAP-19 "wikilink"), developed by Teledyne for previous space
exploration missions.[5] SNAP-19s powered *[Pioneer
10](Pioneer_10 "wikilink")* and *[Pioneer 11](Pioneer_11 "wikilink")*
missions[6] as well as the *[Viking 1](Viking_1 "wikilink")* and
*[Viking 2](Viking_2 "wikilink")* landers.

## Design and specifications

The MMRTG is powered by eight [Pu-238](Pu-238 "wikilink") dioxide
[general-purpose heat source](general-purpose_heat_source "wikilink")
(GPHS) modules, provided by the [US Department of
Energy](United_States_Department_of_Energy "wikilink") (DOE). Initially,
these eight GPHS modules generate about 2 kW thermal power.

The MMRTG design incorporates [PbTe](Lead_telluride "wikilink")/TAGS
thermoelectric couples (from [Teledyne Energy
Systems](Teledyne_Technologies "wikilink")), where TAGS is an acronym
designating a material incorporating [tellurium](tellurium "wikilink")
(Te), [silver](silver "wikilink") (Ag),
[germanium](germanium "wikilink") (Ge) and
[antimony](antimony "wikilink") (Sb). The MMRTG is designed to produce
125 W electrical power at the start of mission, falling to about 100 W
after 14 years.[7] With a mass of 45 kg[8] the MMRTG provides about 2.8
W/kg of electrical power at beginning of life.

The MMRTG design is capable of operating both in the vacuum of space and
in planetary atmospheres, such as on the surface of Mars. Design goals
for the MMRTG included ensuring a high degree of safety, optimizing
power levels over a minimum lifetime of 14 years, and minimizing
weight.[9]

## Usage in space missions

*[Curiosity](Curiosity_rover "wikilink")*, the MSL rover that was
successfully landed in [Gale Crater](Gale_(crater) "wikilink") on August
6, 2012, uses one MMRTG to supply heat and electricity for its
components and science instruments. Reliable power from the MMRTG will
allow it to operate for several years.[10]

On February 20, 2015, a NASA official reported that there is enough
plutonium available to NASA to fuel three more MMRTGs like the one used
by the *Curiosity* rover.[11][12] One is already committed to the [Mars
2020](Mars_2020 "wikilink") and its [*Perseverance*
rover](Perseverance_(rover) "wikilink").[13] The other two have not been
assigned to any specific mission or program,[14] and could be available
by late 2021.[15]

A MMRTG was successfully launched into space on July 30, 2020, aboard
the [Mars 2020](Mars_2020 "wikilink") mission, and is now being used to
supply the scientific equipment on the
[Perseverance](Perseverance_(rover) "wikilink") rover with heat and
power. The MMRTG used by this mission is the F-2 built by Teledyne
Energy Systems, Inc. and Aerojet Rocketdyne under contract with the US
Department of Energy (DOE) with a lifespan of up to 17 years.[16]

The upcoming [NASA](NASA "wikilink")
*[Dragonfly](Dragonfly_(Titan_space_probe) "wikilink")* mission to
Saturn's moon [Titan](Titan_(moon) "wikilink") will use one of the two
MMRTGs for which the Aerojet Rocketdyne/Teledyne Energy Systems team has
recently received a contract.[17] The MMRTG will be used to charge a set
of lithium ion batteries, and then use this higher-power-density supply
to fly a quad helicopter in short hops above the surface of Titan.[18]

## Cost

The MMRTG cost an estimated to produce and deploy, and to research and
develop.[19] For comparison the production and deployment of the
[GPHS-RTG](GPHS-RTG "wikilink") was approximately .
