# Olivia Benson (cat)

**Olivia Benson** is a [Scottish Fold](Scottish_Fold "wikilink") cat
owned by American singer-songwriter [Taylor
Swift](Taylor_Swift "wikilink"). Adopted in June 2014, Olivia has
appeared in multiple commercials and music videos and won or been
nominated for several awards.
[Comparethemarket.com](Comparethemarket.com "wikilink") ranked Olivia as
the [world's second-richest cat](List_of_wealthiest_animals "wikilink"),
with a net worth of $97 million.

## Early life

Olivia Benson was purchased by Swift in June 2014 as a kitten. She
has [osteochondrodysplasia](osteochondrodysplasia "wikilink"), a
painful degenerative joint disease, which affects all Scottish Fold
cats. Olivia, like Swift's other cats, is named after a fictional
character, taking after [Olivia Benson](Olivia_Benson "wikilink"), the
main protagonist of American crime drama series *[Law & Order: Special
Victims Unit](Law_&_Order:_Special_Victims_Unit "wikilink").* Olivia
is the adoptive younger sister of Meredith Grey, another Scottish Fold
named after [the *Grey's Anatomy* character](Meredith_Grey "wikilink"),
and the adoptive older sister of Benjamin Button, a
[Ragdoll](Ragdoll "wikilink") named after the titular character of [*The
Curious Case of Benjamin
Button*](The_Curious_Case_of_Benjamin_Button_(film) "wikilink").
Meredith and Olivia's names, Swift told *[Rolling
Stone](Rolling_Stone "wikilink")* in September 2014, were themed after
"strong, complex, independent women". The adoption announcement
prompted Swift's friend and English singer-songwriter [Ed
Sheeran](Ed_Sheeran "wikilink") to call her "a sort of middle-aged woman
trapped in a 24-year-oldâ€™s body". In September 2014, Swift was
pictured carrying Olivia around the streets of [New York
City](New_York_City "wikilink"); Swift noted that this was due to
Olivia's inability to cope with being in a cat carrier.

## Career

In October 2014, [Keds](Keds "wikilink") released an advertising
campaign featuring Olivia for their "Sneaky Cat" shoes, which featured
Swift's birthday on the back, to promote Swift's album
[*1989*](1989_(Taylor_Swift_album) "wikilink"). Later that month,
Olivia featured in a [Diet Coke](Diet_Coke "wikilink") commercial in
which Swift drank Diet Coke as more and more kittens appeared with every
sip.

In November 2014, Olivia appeared in a Swift music video ("[Blank
Space](Blank_Space "wikilink")") for the first time. In 2015, Olivia
met American actress [Mariska Hargitay](Mariska_Hargitay "wikilink"),
who played the Olivia Benson character in *Law & Order*. In 2017, Ed
Sheeran bought his own Scottish Fold, Calippo, to match Swift's
cats. Increased interest in the breed as a result of Swift and
Sheeran posting them to their [Instagram](Instagram "wikilink") accounts
prompted the [British Veterinary
Association](British_Veterinary_Association "wikilink") to call for a
ban on the breed and for *[Veterinary
Record](Veterinary_Record "wikilink")* to review its use in adverts.
Later that year, Olivia appeared in an outtake of an
[AT&T](AT&T "wikilink") commercial, and the following year she appeared
in a [DirecTV](DirecTV "wikilink") commercial in which Swift rode a
giant "caticorn" version of Olivia.

In 2018, [Comparethemarket.com](Comparethemarket.com "wikilink")
announced their Pet Rich List, which valued Olivia at $97,000,000,
making her the world's second-richest cat, behind [Grumpy
Cat](Grumpy_Cat "wikilink"). In April 2019, Olivia and Meredith
appeared in Swift's "[Me!](Me! "wikilink")" music video, along with
Benjamin, who Swift subsequently adopted. The cats also appeared
in *[Miss Americana](Miss_Americana "wikilink")*, Swift's 2020
autobiographical documentary film. In May 2023, a sleeping
Olivia featured in the music video for Swift's
"[Karma](Karma_(Taylor_Swift_song) "wikilink")".
