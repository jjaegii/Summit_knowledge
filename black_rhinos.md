# Black rhinoceros

The **black rhinoceros**, **black rhino** or **hook-lipped rhinoceros**
(***Diceros bicornis***) is a species of
[rhinoceros](rhinoceros "wikilink"), native to eastern and southern
Africa including [Angola](Angola "wikilink"),
[Botswana](Botswana "wikilink"), [Kenya](Kenya "wikilink"),
[Malawi](Malawi "wikilink"), [Mozambique](Mozambique "wikilink"),
[Namibia](Namibia "wikilink"), [South Africa](South_Africa "wikilink"),
[Eswatini](Eswatini "wikilink"), [Tanzania](Tanzania "wikilink"),
[Zambia](Zambia "wikilink"), and [Zimbabwe](Zimbabwe "wikilink").
Although the species is referred to as *black*, its colours vary from
brown to grey. It is the only extant species of the genus
*[Diceros](Diceros "wikilink")*.

The other African rhinoceros is the [white
rhinoceros](white_rhinoceros "wikilink") (*Ceratotherium simum*). The
word "white" in the name "white rhinoceros" is often said to be a
misinterpretation of the [Afrikaans](Afrikaan "wikilink") word **
([Dutch](Dutch_language "wikilink") **) meaning wide, referring to its
square upper lip, as opposed to the pointed or hooked lip of the black
rhinoceros. These species are now sometimes referred to as the
square-lipped (for white) or hook-lipped (for black) rhinoceros.

The [species](species "wikilink") overall is classified as [critically
endangered](critically_endangered "wikilink") (even though the
[south-western black
rhinoceros](south-western_black_rhinoceros "wikilink") is classified as
[near threatened](Near-threatened_species "wikilink")) and is threatened
by multiple factors including poaching and habitat reduction. Three
[subspecies](subspecies "wikilink") have been declared
[extinct](extinction "wikilink"), including the [western black
rhinoceros](western_black_rhinoceros "wikilink"), which was declared
extinct by the [International Union for Conservation of
Nature](International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature "wikilink")
(IUCN) in 2011. The IUCN estimates that there are 3,142 mature
individuals remaining in the wild.

## Taxonomy

The species was first named *Rhinoceros bicornis* by [Carl
Linnaeus](Carl_Linnaeus "wikilink") in the 10th edition of his *[Systema
naturae](Systema_naturae "wikilink")* in 1758. The name means
"double-horned rhinoceros". There is some confusion about what exactly
Linnaeus conceived under this name as this species was probably based
upon the skull of a single-horned [Indian
rhinoceros](Indian_rhinoceros "wikilink") (*Rhinoceros unicornis*), with
a second horn artificially added by the collector. Such a skull is known
to have existed and Linnaeus even mentioned [India](India "wikilink") as
origin of this species. However he also referred to reports from early
travellers about a double-horned rhino in Africa and when it emerged
that there is only one, single-horned species of rhino in India,
*Rhinoceros bicornis* was used to refer to the African rhinos (the
[white rhino](white_rhino "wikilink") only became recognised in
1812). In 1911 this was formally fixed and the [Cape of Good
Hope](Cape_of_Good_Hope "wikilink") officially declared the [type
locality](type_locality_(biology) "wikilink") of the species.

### Subspecies

The intraspecific variation in the black rhinoceros has been discussed
by various authors and is not finally settled. The most accepted
scheme considers seven or eight subspecies, of which three
became extinct in historical times and one is on the brink of
[extinction](extinction "wikilink"):

-   [Southern black rhinoceros](Southern_black_rhinoceros "wikilink") or
    Cape black rhinoceros (*D. b. bicornis*) – Extinct. Once abundant
    from the [Cape of Good Hope](Cape_of_Good_Hope "wikilink") to
    [Transvaal](Transvaal_Province "wikilink"), [South
    Africa](Republic_of_South_Africa "wikilink") and probably into the
    south of [Namibia](Namibia "wikilink"), this was the largest
    subspecies. It became extinct due to excessive hunting and habitat
    destruction around 1850.
-   [North-eastern black
    rhinoceros](North-eastern_black_rhinoceros "wikilink") (*D. b.
    brucii*) – Extinct. Formerly central [Sudan](Sudan "wikilink"),
    [Eritrea](Eritrea "wikilink"), northern and southeastern
    [Ethiopia](Ethiopia "wikilink"), [Djibouti](Djibouti "wikilink") and
    northern and southeastern [Somalia](Somalia "wikilink"). Relict
    populations in northern Somalia vanished during the early 20th
    century.
-   [Chobe black rhinoceros](Chobe_Rhinoceros "wikilink") (*D. b.
    chobiensis*) – A local subspecies restricted to the [Chobe
    Valley](Chobe_River "wikilink") in southeastern
    [Angola](Angola "wikilink"), Namibia ([Zambezi
    Region](Zambezi_Region "wikilink")) and northern
    [Botswana](Botswana "wikilink"). Nearly extinct, possibly only one
    surviving specimen in Botswana.
-   [Uganda black rhinoceros](Uganda_black_rhinoceros "wikilink")
    (*D. b. ladoensis*) – Former distribution from [South
    Sudan](South_Sudan "wikilink"), across [Uganda](Uganda "wikilink")
    into western [Kenya](Kenya "wikilink") and southwesternmost
    [Ethiopia](Ethiopia "wikilink"). Black rhinos are considered extinct
    across most of this area and its conservational status is unclear.
    Probably surviving in Kenyan reserves.
-   [Western black rhinoceros](Western_black_rhinoceros "wikilink")
    (*D. b. longipes*) – Extinct. Once lived in [South
    Sudan](South_Sudan "wikilink"), northern [Central African
    Republic](Central_African_Republic "wikilink"), southern
    [Chad](Chad "wikilink"), northern [Cameroon](Cameroon "wikilink"),
    northeastern [Nigeria](Nigeria "wikilink") and south-eastern
    [Niger](Niger "wikilink"). The range possibly stretched west to the
    [Niger River](Niger_River "wikilink") in western
    [Niger](Niger "wikilink"), though this is unconfirmed. The evidence
    from Liberia and Burkina Faso mainly rests upon the existence of
    indigenous names for the rhinoceros. A far greater former range
    in [West Africa](West_Africa "wikilink") as proposed earlier is
    doubted by a 2004 study. The last known wild specimens lived in
    northern [Cameroon](Cameroon "wikilink"). In 2006 an intensive
    survey across its putative range in Cameroon failed to locate any,
    leading to fears that it was extinct in the wild. On 10
    November 2011 the [IUCN](IUCN "wikilink") declared the [western
    black rhinoceros](western_black_rhinoceros "wikilink")
    [extinct](extinct "wikilink").
-   [Eastern black rhinoceros](Eastern_black_rhinoceros "wikilink")
    (*D. b. michaeli*) – Had a historical distribution from [South
    Sudan](South_Sudan "wikilink"), [Uganda](Uganda "wikilink"),
    [Ethiopia](Ethiopia "wikilink"), down through Kenya into
    north-central Tanzania. Today, its range is limited primarily to
    Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania. In addition, its population is in South
    Africa's [Addo Elephant National
    Park](Addo_Elephant_National_Park "wikilink").
-   [South-central black
    rhinoceros](South-central_black_rhinoceros "wikilink") (*D. b.
    minor*) – Most widely distributed subspecies, characterised by a
    compact body, proportionally large head and prominent skin-folds.
    Ranged from north-eastern South Africa
    ([KwaZulu-Natal](KwaZulu-Natal "wikilink")) to northeastern
    [Tanzania](Tanzania "wikilink") and southeastern
    [Kenya](Kenya "wikilink"). Preserved in reserves throughout most of
    its former range but probably extinct in eastern
    [Angola](Angola "wikilink"), southern [Democratic Republic of
    Congo](Democratic_Republic_of_Congo "wikilink") and possibly
    [Mozambique](Mozambique "wikilink"). Extinct but reintroduced in
    [Malawi](Malawi "wikilink"), [Botswana](Botswana "wikilink"), and
    [Zambia](Zambia "wikilink"). It also ranges in parts of
    [Namibia](Namibia "wikilink") and inhabit national parks in [South
    Africa](South_Africa "wikilink").
-   [South-western black
    rhinoceros](South-western_black_rhinoceros "wikilink") (*D. b.
    occidentalis*) – A small subspecies, adapted to survival in desert
    and semi-desert conditions. Originally distributed in north-western
    Namibia and southwestern [Angola](Angola "wikilink"), today
    restricted to wildlife reserves in Namibia with sporadic sightings
    in Angola. These populations are often referred to *D. b. bicornis*
    or *D. b. minor*, but some experts consider them a subspecies in
    their own right.

The most widely adopted alternative scheme only recognizes five
subspecies or "eco-types": *D. b. bicornis*, *D. b. brucii*, *D. b.
longipes*, *D. b. michaeli*, and *D. b. minor*. This concept is also
used by the [IUCN](IUCN "wikilink"), listing three surviving subspecies
and recognizing *D. b. brucii* and *D. b. longipes* as extinct. The most
important difference to the above scheme is the inclusion of the extant
southwestern subspecies from Namibia in *D. b. bicornis* instead of in
its own subspecies, whereupon the nominal subspecies is considered
extant.

### Evolution

The rhinoceros originated in the [Eocene](Eocene "wikilink") about fifty
million years ago alongside other members of
[Perissodactyla](Perissodactyla "wikilink"). Ancestors of the black
and the white rhinoceros were present in Africa by the end of the [Late
Miocene](Miocene "wikilink") about ten million years ago. The two
species evolved from the common ancestral species *[Ceratotherium
neumayri](Ceratotherium_neumayri "wikilink")* during this time. The
[clade](clade "wikilink") comprising the [genus](genus "wikilink")
*Diceros* is characterised by an increased adaptation to
[browsing](Browsing_(herbivory) "wikilink"). Between four and five
million years ago, the black rhinoceros diverged from the white
rhinoceros. After this split, the direct ancestor of *Diceros
bicornis*, *[Diceros praecox](Diceros_praecox "wikilink")* was present
in the [Pliocene](Pliocene "wikilink") of East Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya,
Tanzania). *D. bicornis* evolved from this [species](species "wikilink")
during the [Late Pliocene](Pliocene "wikilink") – [Early
Pleistocene](Pleistocene "wikilink"), with the oldest definitive
record at the Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary c. 2.5 million years ago at
[Koobi Fora](Koobi_Fora "wikilink"), Kenya.

## Description

An adult black rhinoceros stands high at the shoulder and is in
length. An adult typically weighs from , however unusually
large male specimens have been reported at up to . The cows are
smaller than the bulls. Two [horns](horn_(anatomy) "wikilink") on the
skull are made of [keratin](keratin "wikilink") with the larger front
horn typically long, exceptionally up to .

The longest known black rhinoceros horn measured nearly in length.
Sometimes a third, smaller horn may develop. These horns are used
for defense, intimidation, and digging up roots and breaking branches
during feeding. The black rhino is smaller than the [white
rhino](white_rhino "wikilink") and close in size to the [Javan
rhino](Javan_rhino "wikilink") of Indonesia. It has a pointed and
prehensile upper lip, which it uses to grasp leaves and twigs when
feeding, whereas the white rhinoceros has square lips used for
eating grass. The black rhinoceros can also be distinguished from the
white rhinoceros by its size, smaller skull, and ears; and by the
position of the head, which is held higher than the white rhinoceros,
since the black rhinoceros is a browser and not a grazer.

Their thick-layered skin helps to protect black rhinos from
[thorns](Thorns,_spines,_and_prickles "wikilink") and sharp
[grasses](grass "wikilink"). Their skin harbors external
[parasites](parasitism "wikilink"), such as [mites](mite "wikilink") and
[ticks](tick "wikilink"), which may be eaten by
[oxpeckers](oxpecker "wikilink") and [egrets](egret "wikilink").
Such behaviour was originally thought to be an example of
[mutualism](Mutualism_(biology) "wikilink"), but recent evidence
suggests that [oxpeckers](oxpecker "wikilink") may be parasites instead,
feeding on rhino blood. It is commonly assumed that black rhinos
have poor eyesight, relying more on hearing and smell. However, studies
have shown that their eyesight is comparatively good, at about the level
of a rabbit. Their ears have a relatively wide rotational range to
detect sounds. An excellent sense of smell alerts rhinos to the presence
of [predators](predation "wikilink").

## Distribution

### Prehistorical range

As with many other components of the African large mammal fauna, black
rhinos probably had a wider range in the northern part of the continent
in prehistoric times than today. However this seems to have not been as
extensive as that of the white rhino. Unquestionable fossil remains have
not yet been found in this area and the abundant
[petroglyphs](petroglyphs "wikilink") found across the
[Sahara](Sahara "wikilink") desert are often too schematic to
unambiguously decide whether they depict black or white rhinos.
Petroglyphs from the [Eastern Desert](Eastern_Desert "wikilink") of
southeastern Egypt relatively convincingly show the occurrence of black
rhinos in these areas in prehistoric times.

### Historical and extant range

The natural range of the black rhino included most of southern and
eastern Africa, except the [Congo Basin](Congo_Basin "wikilink"), the
[tropical rainforest](tropical_rainforest "wikilink") areas along the
[Bight of Benin](Bight_of_Benin "wikilink"), the [Ethiopian
Highlands](Ethiopian_Highlands "wikilink"), and the [Horn of
Africa](Horn_of_Africa "wikilink"). Its former native occurrence in
the extremely dry parts of the [Kalahari
desert](Kalahari_desert "wikilink") of southwestern
[Botswana](Botswana "wikilink") and northwestern [South
Africa](Republic_of_South_Africa "wikilink") is uncertain. It was
abundant in an area stretching from [Eritrea](Eritrea "wikilink") and
[Sudan](Sudan "wikilink") through [South Sudan](South_Sudan "wikilink")
to southeastern [Niger](Niger "wikilink"), especially around [Lake
Chad](Lake_Chad "wikilink"). Its occurrence further to the west is
questionable, although this is often claimed in literature. Today it
is found only in protected [nature
reserves](nature_reserves "wikilink"), having vanished from many
countries in which it once thrived, especially in the west and north of
its former range. The remaining populations are highly scattered. Some
specimens have been relocated from their habitat to better protected
locations, sometimes across national frontiers. The black rhino has
been successfully reintroduced to [Malawi](Malawi "wikilink") since
1993, where it became extinct in 1990. Similarly it was reintroduced
to [Zambia](Zambia "wikilink") ([North Luangwa National
Park](North_Luangwa_National_Park "wikilink")) in 2008, where it had
become extinct in 1998, and to Botswana (extinct in 1992,
reintroduced in 2003).

In May 2017, 18 eastern black rhinos were translocated from South Africa
to the [Akagera National Park](Akagera_National_Park "wikilink") in
Rwanda. The park had around 50 rhinos in the 1970s but the numbers
dwindled to zero by 2007. In September 2017, the birth of a calf raised
the population to 19. The park has dedicated rhino monitoring teams to
protect the animals from poaching.

In October 2017, The governments of Chad and South Africa reached an
agreement to transfer six black rhinos from South Africa to [Zakouma
National Park](Zakouma_National_Park "wikilink") in Chad. Once
established, this will be the northernmost population of the species.
The species was wiped out from Chad in the 1970s and is under severe
pressure from poaching in South Africa. The agreement calls for South
African experts to assess the habitat, local management capabilities,
security and the infrastructure before the transfer can take place.

## Behavior

Black rhinos are generally thought to be solitary, with the only strong
bond between a mother and her calf. In addition, bulls and cows have a
consort relationship during mating, also subadults and young adults
frequently form loose associations with older individuals of either
sex. They are not very [territorial](territory_(animal) "wikilink")
and often intersect other rhino territories. Home ranges vary depending
on season and the availability of food and water. Generally they have
smaller home ranges and larger density in habitats that have plenty of
food and water available, and vice versa if resources are not readily
available. Sex and age of an individual black rhino influence home range
and size, with ranges of cows larger than those of bulls, especially
when accompanied by a calf. In the [Serengeti](Serengeti "wikilink")
home ranges are around , while in the
[Ngorongoro](Ngorongoro_Conservation_Area "wikilink") it is between
. Black rhinos have also been observed to have a certain area they
tend to visit and rest frequently called "houses" which are usually on a
high ground level. These "home" ranges can vary from 2.6 km<sup>2</sup>
to 133 km<sup>2</sup> with smaller home ranges having more abundant
resources than larger home ranges.

Black rhinos in captivity and reservations sleep patterns have been
recently studied to show that males sleep longer on average than females
by nearly double the time. Other factors that play a role in their
sleeping patterns is the location of where they decide to sleep.
Although they do not sleep any longer in captivity, they do sleep at
different times due to their location in captivity, or section of the
park.

Black rhinos have a reputation for being extremely aggressive, and
charge readily at perceived threats. They have even been observed to
charge tree trunks and termite mounds. Black rhinos will fight each
other, and they have the highest rates of mortal combat recorded for any
mammal: about 50% of males and 30% of females die from combat-related
injuries. Adult rhinos normally have no natural predators, thanks to
their imposing size as well as their thick skin and deadly horns.
However, adult black rhinos have fallen prey to
[crocodiles](Nile_crocodile "wikilink") in exceptional
circumstances. Calves and, very seldom, small sub-adults may be
preyed upon by [lions](lion "wikilink") as well.

Black rhinos follow the same trails that elephants use to get from
foraging areas to water holes. They also use smaller trails when they
are [browsing](Browsing_(herbivory) "wikilink"). They are very fast and
can get up to speeds of running on their toes.

While it was assumed all rhinoceros are short-sighted, a study involving
black rhinoceros retinas suggests they have better eyesight than
previously assumed.

### Diet

Black rhinos are [herbivorous](herbivore "wikilink")
[browsers](Browsing_(herbivory) "wikilink") that eat leafy plants,
twigs, branches, shoots, thorny wood bushes, small trees, legumes,
fruit, and grass. The optimum habitat seems to be one consisting
of thick scrub and bushland, often with some woodland, which supports
the highest densities. Their diet can reduce the number of woody plants,
which may benefit grazers (who focus on leaves and stems of grass), but
not competing browsers (who focus on leaves, stems of trees, shrubs or
herbs). It has been known to eat up to 220 species of plants. They have
a significantly restricted diet with a preference for a few key plant
species and a tendency to select leafy species in the dry season.
The plant species they seem to be most attracted to when not in dry
season are the woody plants. There are 18 species of woody plants known
to the diet of the black rhinoceros, and 11 species that could possibly
be a part of their diet too. Black rhinos also have a tendency to
choose food based on quality over quantity, where researchers find more
populations in areas where the food has better quality. Black rhinos
show a preference for *[Acacia](Acacia "wikilink")* species, as well as
plants in the family [Euphorbiaceae](Euphorbiaceae "wikilink").

In accordance with their feeding habit, adaptations of the chewing
apparatus have been described for rhinos. The black rhinoceros has a two
phased chewing activity with a cutting ectoloph and more grinding lophs
on the lingual side. The black rhinoceros can also be considered a more
challenging herbivore to feed in captivity compared to its grazing
relatives. They can live up to 5 days without water during drought.
Black rhinos live in several habitats including bushlands, Riverine
woodland, marshes, and their least favorable, grasslands. Habitat
preferences are shown in two ways, the amount of sign found in the
different habitats, and the habitat content of home ranges and core
areas. Habitat types are also identified based on the composition of
dominant plant types in each area. Different subspecies live in
different habitats including *[Vachellia](Vachellia "wikilink")* and
*[Senegalia](Senegalia "wikilink")* savanna,
*[Euclea](Euclea "wikilink")* bushlands, [Albany
thickets](Albany_thickets "wikilink"), and even desert. They browse
for food in the morning and evening. They are selective browsers but,
studies done in Kenya show that they do add the selection material with
availability in order to satisfy their nutritional requirements. In
the hottest part of the day they are most inactive- resting, sleeping,
and wallowing in mud. Wallowing helps cool down body temperature during
the day and protects against parasites. When black rhinos browse they
use their lips to strip the branches of their leaves. Competition with
elephants is causing the black rhinoceros to shift its diet. The black
rhinoceros alters its selectivity with the absence of the elephant.

There is some variance in the exact chemical composition of rhinoceros
horns. This variation is directly linked to diet and can be used as a
means of rhino identification. Horn composition has helped scientists
pinpoint the original location of individual rhinos, allowing for law
enforcement to more accurately and more frequently identify and penalize
poachers.

### Communication

Black rhinos use several forms of communication. Due to their solitary
nature, [scent marking](spraying_(animal_behavior) "wikilink") is often
used to identify themselves to other black rhinos. [Urine
spraying](Urine_spraying "wikilink") occurs on trees and bushes, around
water holes and feeding areas. Cows urine spray more often when
receptive for breeding. Defecation sometimes occurs in the same spot
used by different black rhinos, such as around feeding stations and
watering tracks. Coming upon these spots, rhinos will smell to see who
is in the area and add their own marking. When presented with adult
feces, bulls and cows respond differently than when they are presented
with subadult feces. The urine and feces of one black rhinoceros helps
other black rhinoceroses to determine its age, sex, and identity.
Less commonly they will rub their heads or horns against tree trunks to
scent-mark.

The black rhino has powerful tube-shaped ears that can freely rotate in
all directions. This highly developed sense of hearing allows black
rhinos to detect sound over vast distances.

### Reproduction

The adults are solitary in nature, coming together only for mating.
Mating does not have a seasonal pattern but births tend to be towards
the end of the rainy season in more arid environments.

When in season the cows will mark dung piles. Bulls will follow cows
when they are in season; when she defecates he will scrape and spread
the dung, making it more difficult for rival adult bulls to pick up her
scent trail.

Courtship behaviors before mating include snorting and sparring with the
horns among males. Another courtship behavior is called bluff and
bluster, where the black rhino will snort and swing its head from side
to side aggressively before running away repeatedly. Breeding pairs stay
together for 2–3 days and sometimes even weeks. They mate several times
a day over this time and copulation lasts for a half-hour.

The gestation period for a black rhino is 15 months. The single calf
weighs about at birth, and can follow its mother around after just three
days. Weaning occurs at around 2 years of age for the offspring. The
mother and calf stay together for 2–3 years until the next calf is born;
female calves may stay longer, forming small groups. The young are
occasionally taken by [hyenas](hyena "wikilink") and
[lions](lion "wikilink"). Sexual maturity is reached from 5 to 7 years
old for females, and 7 to 8 years for males. The life expectancy in
natural conditions (without [poaching](poaching "wikilink") pressure) is
from 35 to 50 years.

## Conservation

For most of the 20th century the continental black rhino was the most
numerous of all rhino species. Around 1900 there were probably several
hundred thousand living in Africa. During the latter half of the
20th century their numbers were severely reduced from an estimated
70,000 in the late 1960s to only 10,000 to 15,000 in 1981. In the
early 1990s the number dipped below 2,500, and in 2004 it was reported
that only 2,410 black rhinos remained. According to the [International
Rhino Foundation](International_Rhino_Foundation "wikilink")—housed in
[Yulee, Florida](Yulee,_Florida "wikilink") at [White Oak
Conservation](White_Oak_Conservation "wikilink"), which breeds black
rhinos—the total African population had recovered to 4,240 by 2008
(which suggests that the 2004 number was low). By 2009 the
population of 5,500 was either steady or slowly increasing.

In 1992, nine black rhinos were brought from Chete National Park,
Zimbabwe to Australia via Cocos Island. After the natural deaths of the
males in the group, four males were brought in from United States and
have since adapted well to captivity and new climate. Calves and
some subadults are preyed on by lions, but predation is rarely taken
into account in managing the black rhinoceros. This is a major flaw
because predation should be considered when attributing cause to the
poor performance of the black rhinoceros population. In 2002 only
ten western black rhinos remained in Cameroon, and in 2006 intensive
surveys across its putative range failed to locate any, leading to fears
that this subspecies had become extinct. In 2011 the
[IUCN](IUCN "wikilink") declared the western black rhino
[extinct](extinct "wikilink"). There was a conservation effort in
which black rhinos were translocated, but their population did not
improve, as they did not like to be in an unfamiliar habitat.

Under [CITES](CITES "wikilink") Appendix I all international commercial
trade of the black rhino horn is prohibited since 1977. China though
having joined CITES since 8 April 1981 is the largest importer of black
rhino horns. However, this is a trade in which not only do the
actors benefit, but so do the nation states ignoring them as well.
Nevertheless, people continue to remove the rhino from its natural
environment and allow for a dependence on human beings to save them from
endangerment. Parks and reserves have been made for protecting the
rhinos with armed guards keeping watch, but even still many poachers get
through and harm the rhinos for their horns. Many have considered
extracting rhino horns in order to deter poachers from slaughtering
these animals or potentially bringing them to other breeding grounds
such as the US and Australia. This method of extracting the horn,
known as dehorning, consists of tranquilizing the rhino then sawing the
horn almost completely off to decrease initiative for poaching, although
the effectiveness of this in reducing poaching is not known and rhino
mothers are known to use their horns to fend off predators.

The only rhino subspecies that has recovered somewhat from the brink of
extinction is the [southern white
rhinoceros](southern_white_rhinoceros "wikilink"), whose numbers now are
estimated around 14,500, up from fewer than 50 in the first decade of
the 20th century. But there seems to be hope for the black
rhinoceros in recovering their gametes from dead rhinos in captivity.
This shows promising results for producing black rhinoceros embryos,
which can be used for testing sperm in vitro.

A January 2014 auction for a permit to hunt a black rhinoceros in
[Namibia](Namibia "wikilink") sold for $350,000 at a fundraiser hosted
by the Dallas Safari Club. The auction drew considerable criticism as
well as death threats directed towards members of the club and the man
who purchased the permit. This permit was issued for 1 of 18 black
rhinoceros specifically identified by Namibia's Ministry of Environment
and Tourism as being past breeding age and considered a threat to
younger rhinos. The $350,000 that the hunter paid for the permit was
used by the Namibian government to fund anti-poaching efforts in the
country.

In 2022 [South Africa](South_Africa "wikilink") granted permits to hunt
10 black rhinos, stating that the population is growing.

## Threats

Today, there are various threats posed to black rhinos including habitat
changes, illegal poaching, and competing species. Civil disturbances,
such as war, have made mentionably negative effects on the black
rhinoceros populations in since the 1960s in countries including, but
not limited to, Chad, Cameroon, Rwanda, Mozambique, and Somalia. In
the [Addo Elephant National
Park](Addo_Elephant_National_Park "wikilink") in South Africa, the
African bush elephant (*[Loxodonta
africana](Loxodonta_africana "wikilink")*) is posing slight concern
involving the black rhinoceroses who also inhabit the area. Both animals
are browsers; however, the elephant's diet consists of a wider variety
of foraging capacity, while the black rhinoceros primarily sticks to
dwarf shrubs. The black rhinoceros has been found to eat grass as well;
however, the shortening of its range of available food could be
potentially problematic.

Black rhinos face problems associated with the minerals they ingest.
They have become adjusted to ingesting less iron in the wild due to
their evolutionary progression, which poses a problem when placed in
captivity. These rhinoceroses can overload on iron, which leads to build
up in the lungs, liver, spleen and small intestine. Not only do
these rhinoceros face threats being in the wild, but in captivity too.
Black rhinoceros have become more susceptible to disease in captivity
with high rates of mortality.

Illegal poaching for the international rhino horn trade is the main and
most detrimental threat. The killing of these animals is not unique
to modern-day society. The Chinese have maintained reliable documents of
these happenings dating back to 1200 B.C. The ancient Chinese often
hunted rhino horn for the making of wine cups, as well as the rhino's
skin to manufacture imperial crowns, belts and armor for soldiers.
A major market for rhino horn has historically been in the [Middle
East](Middle_East "wikilink") nations to make ornately carved handles
for ceremonial daggers called [jambiyas](jambiya "wikilink"). Demand for
these exploded in the 1970s, causing the black rhinoceros population to
decline 96% between 1970 and 1992. The horn is also used in [traditional
Chinese medicine](traditional_Chinese_medicine "wikilink"), and is said
by [herbalists](herbalist "wikilink") to be able to revive comatose
patients, facilitate exorcisms and various methods of detoxification,
and cure fevers. It is also hunted for the Chinese superstitious
belief that the horns allow direct access to Heaven due to their unique
location and hollow nature. The purported effectiveness of the use
of rhino horn in treating any illness has not been confirmed, or even
suggested, by medical science. In June 2007, the first-ever documented
case of the medicinal sale of black rhino horn in the United States
(confirmed by genetic testing of the confiscated horn) occurred at a
[traditional Chinese medicine](traditional_Chinese_medicine "wikilink")
supply store in [Portland, Oregon](Portland,_Oregon "wikilink")'s
[Chinatown](Chinatown "wikilink").
