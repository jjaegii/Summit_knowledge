# Alix Earle

**Alix Ashley Earle** (born December 16, 2000) is an American [social
media personality](Internet_celebrity "wikilink") on the video-sharing
platform [TikTok](TikTok "wikilink"). With over six million followers on
social media, she has been called TikTok's "[It
girl](It_girl "wikilink")" and "hot best friend" from the popularity of
her "Get Ready With Me" confessional videos, in which she openly shares
details of her personal life. Her ability to drive sales for the brands
she promotes on her accounts has been dubbed the "Alix Earle
effect".[1][2][3][4][5]

## Early life and education

Earle was born December 16, 2000,[6] in [Monmouth County, New
Jersey](Monmouth_County,_New_Jersey "wikilink"), the oldest of five
children, to Thomas "TJ" Earle, a construction magnate in [Wall
Township, New Jersey](Wall_Township,_New_Jersey "wikilink"), and Alisa
Maniaci, who is of [Italian](Italians "wikilink") descent. [7][8][9] Her
parents met each other at [Lynn University](Lynn_University "wikilink")
in [Boca Raton, Florida](Boca_Raton,_Florida "wikilink").[10] Thomas
Earle's construction company makes an estimated revenue of $24.1 million
annually.[11]

In July 2008, the [*New York Post*](New_York_Post "wikilink") reported
that Earle's father Thomas was having an [affair](affair "wikilink")
with [Ashley Alexandra Dupré](Ashley_Alexandra_Dupré "wikilink"), an
[escort](Call_girl "wikilink") best known for her involvement in [a
political sex scandal](Eliot_Spitzer_prostitution_scandal "wikilink")
that resulted in the resignation of one of her
[clients](Client_(prostitution) "wikilink"), [Elliot
Spitzer](Eliot_Spitzer "wikilink"), then [governor of New
York](governor_of_New_York "wikilink").[12] When
[paparazzi](paparazzi "wikilink") came to Earle's house, she was
shuffled away by her mother to their cousins' house and kept in the dark
about what was unfolding. She had no knowledge of the incident until she
looked up her family in fourth grade. Earle's parents later divorced in
2013,[13] and in October of that year, her father remarried to
Dupré.[14][15]

In 2019, Earle graduated from [Red Bank Catholic High
School](Red_Bank_Catholic_High_School "wikilink") in [Red Bank, New
Jersey](Red_Bank,_New_Jersey "wikilink").[16]

She attended the [University of Miami](University_of_Miami "wikilink"),
where she graduated in May 2023[17] from the [Miami Herbert Business
School](Miami_Herbert_Business_School "wikilink") with a degree in
marketing. In August 2023, Earle endowed the Alix Earle Scholarship for
students at the business school.[18]

## Career

In February 2020 as a [University of
Miami](University_of_Miami "wikilink") freshman, Earle began posting on
[TikTok](TikTok "wikilink").[19] Her first video depicted her and her
friends showing off their outfits, which were made of trash bags.[20]

In a 2023 interview on *[The Howard Stern
Show](The_Howard_Stern_Show "wikilink")*, Earle stated that she
initially attempted to fulfill an idealized, perfect persona. "When I
started out, I had no idea. I was trying to be picture perfect. I
thought that was the way to go."[21]

Earle's growth on TikTok accelerated in the summer of 2022, when she was
affected by acne stemming from an excessive facial
[cyst](cyst "wikilink"). Her manager informed her that she had to post a
[sponsored](Sponsor_(commercial) "wikilink") video on her TikTok. Due to
her acne, she initially refused, but later decided that she could use
her platform to help others struggling with the same issue. Earle later
described the viewer response as positive and supportive.[22]

After her acne video, Earle began posting "Get Ready With Me" (GRWM)
videos showcasing her makeup routine while discussing her daily
life.[23] The move proved to be popular with viewers, and Earle
accumulated two million new followers on TikTok by the end of 2022.[24]

In December 2022, she broke up with [Tyler Wade](Tyler_Wade "wikilink"),
a professional baseball player with the [Oakland
Athletics](Oakland_Athletics "wikilink") she had been dating.[25]
Earle's following on TikTok grew further, leading her to be called the
app's "It Girl" by January 2023.[26] Several weeks after the breakup,
her follower count had grown by more than two million.[27] By April
2023, Earle's follower count on TikTok exceeded 5.6 million,[28] which
was a 1,000-percent increase over six months.[29] She receives between
two million and thirty million views on average per post.[30]

In August 2023, Earle was announced as one of the first two content
partners of [Alexandra Cooper](Alexandra_Cooper "wikilink")'s The Unwell
Network, a talent network.[31] The Unwell Network produces Earle's
podcast, "Hot Mess with Alix Earle."[32] "Hot Mess with Alix Earle”
briefly unseated "[The Joe Rogan
Experience](The_Joe_Rogan_Experience "wikilink")," from the top spot of
[Spotify's](Spotify "wikilink") podcast charts, where it had sat
uncontested for the previous two years.[33]

Earle was named in the [*Forbes* 30 Under
30](Forbes_30_Under_30 "wikilink") list for 2023.[34]

## Personal life

Earle began dating [San Diego Padres](San_Diego_Padres "wikilink")
player [Tyler Wade](Tyler_Wade "wikilink") in December 2022, and ended
the relationship three months later. Earle later announced in a TikTok
that the relationship ended because Wade did not support her career.[35]

In November 2023, Earle confirmed her relationship with [Braxton
Berrios](Braxton_Berrios "wikilink"), a [wide
receiver](wide_receiver "wikilink") with the [Miami
Dolphins](Miami_Dolphins "wikilink").[36][37]

In October of 2023, Alix spoke publicly about her struggles with an
eating disorder and [body
dysmorphia](Body_dysmorphic_disorder "wikilink") during high school.[38]

## "Alix Earle effect"

Earle's popularity and fan loyalty often causes the brands she promotes
to sell out very fast, which has been dubbed the "Alix Earle
effect".[39][40][41][42] According to Ubiquitous, a marketing company,
one of Earle's videos can increase searches for a product by as much as
100% in one day. Earle earns as much as $40,000 to $70,000 for each
sponsored video.[43]
