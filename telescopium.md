# Telescopium

**Telescopium** is a minor [constellation](constellation "wikilink") in
the southern [celestial hemisphere](Celestial_sphere "wikilink"), one of
twelve named in the 18th century by French
[astronomer](astronomer "wikilink") [Nicolas-Louis de
Lacaille](Nicolas-Louis_de_Lacaille "wikilink") and one of several
depicting scientific instruments. Its name is a
[Latinized](Latin "wikilink") form of the
[Greek](Ancient_Greek "wikilink") word for
[telescope](telescope "wikilink"). Telescopium was later much reduced in
size by [Francis Baily](Francis_Baily "wikilink") and [Benjamin
Gould](Benjamin_Apthorp_Gould "wikilink").

The brightest star in the constellation is [Alpha
Telescopii](Alpha_Telescopii "wikilink"), a blue-white
[subgiant](subgiant "wikilink") with an [apparent
magnitude](apparent_magnitude "wikilink") of 3.5, followed by the orange
giant star [Zeta Telescopii](Zeta_Telescopii "wikilink") at magnitude
4.1. [Eta](Eta_Telescopii "wikilink") and [PZ
Telescopii](PZ_Telescopii "wikilink") are two young star systems with
[debris disks](debris_disk "wikilink") and [brown
dwarf](brown_dwarf "wikilink") companions. Telescopium hosts two unusual
stars with very little hydrogen that are likely to be the result of two
merged [white dwarfs](white_dwarf "wikilink"): [PV
Telescopii](PV_Telescopii "wikilink"), also known as HD 168476, is a hot
blue [extreme helium star](extreme_helium_star "wikilink"), while [RS
Telescopii](RS_Telescopii "wikilink") is an [R Coronae Borealis
variable](R_Coronae_Borealis_variable "wikilink"). [RR
Telescopii](RR_Telescopii "wikilink") is a [cataclysmic
variable](cataclysmic_variable "wikilink") that brightened as a
[nova](nova "wikilink") to magnitude 6 in 1948.

It had been hypothesized in 2020 that Telescopium would also host the
first known visible star system with a black hole, [QV Telescopii (HR
6819)](HR_6819 "wikilink"), however observations in 2022 indicated that
this is a binary system of two main-sequence stars without a black hole
instead.

## History

Telescopium was introduced in 1751–52 by [Nicolas-Louis de
Lacaille](Nicolas-Louis_de_Lacaille "wikilink") with the French name *le
Telescope*, depicting an [aerial
telescope](aerial_telescope "wikilink"), after he had observed and
catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the [Cape of
Good Hope](Cape_of_Good_Hope "wikilink"). He devised 14 new
constellations in uncharted regions of the [Southern Celestial
Hemisphere](Southern_Celestial_Hemisphere "wikilink") not visible from
Europe. All but one honored instruments that symbolised the [Age of
Enlightenment](Age_of_Enlightenment "wikilink"). Covering 40 degrees of
the night sky, the telescope stretched out northwards between
Sagittarius and Scorpius. Lacaille had Latinised its name to
*Telescopium* by 1763.

The constellation was known by other names. It was called *Tubus
Astronomicus* in the eighteenth century, during which time three
constellations depicting telescopes were recognised—[Tubus Herschelii
Major](Telescopium_Herschelii "wikilink") between Gemini and Auriga and
[Tubus Herschelii Minor](Tubus_Herschelii_Minor "wikilink") between
Taurus and Orion, both of which had fallen out of use by the nineteenth
century. [Johann Bode](Johann_Elert_Bode "wikilink") called it the
*Astronomische Fernrohr* in his 1805 *Gestirne* and kept its size, but
later astronomers [Francis Baily](Francis_Baily "wikilink") and
[Benjamin Gould](Benjamin_Apthorp_Gould "wikilink") subsequently shrank
its boundaries. The much-reduced constellation lost several brighter
stars to neighbouring constellations: Beta Telescopii became [Eta
Sagittarii](Eta_Sagittarii "wikilink"), which it had been before
Lacaille placed it in Telescopium, Gamma was placed in Scorpius and
renamed [G Scorpii](G_Scorpii "wikilink") by Gould, Theta Telescopii
reverted to its old appellation of [d Ophiuchi](45_Ophiuchi "wikilink"),
and Sigma Telescopii was placed in Corona Australis. Initially
uncatalogued, the latter is now known as [HR 6875](HR_6875 "wikilink").
The original object Lacaille had named Eta Telescopii—the open cluster
[Messier 7](Messier_7 "wikilink")—was in what is now Scorpius, and Gould
used the Bayer designation for a magnitude 5 star, which he felt
warranted a letter.

## Characteristics

A small constellation, Telescopium is bordered by
[Sagittarius](Sagittarius_(constellation) "wikilink") and [Corona
Australis](Corona_Australis "wikilink") to the north,
[Ara](Ara_(constellation) "wikilink") to the west,
[Pavo](Pavo_(constellation) "wikilink") to the south, and
[Indus](Indus_(constellation) "wikilink") to the east, cornering on
[Microscopium](Microscopium "wikilink") to the northeast. The
three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the
[International Astronomical
Union](International_Astronomical_Union "wikilink") in 1922, is "Tel".
The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer
[Eugène Delporte](Eugène_Joseph_Delporte "wikilink") in 1930, are
defined by a [quadrilateral](quadrilateral "wikilink"). In the
[equatorial coordinate system](equatorial_coordinate_system "wikilink"),
the [right ascension](right_ascension "wikilink") coordinates of these
borders lie between and , while the
[declination](declination "wikilink") coordinates are between −45.09°
and −56.98°. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of
latitude [33°N](33rd_parallel_north "wikilink").

## Features

### Stars

Within the constellation's borders, there are 57 stars brighter than or
equal to [apparent magnitude](apparent_magnitude "wikilink") 6.5. With a
magnitude of 3.5, [Alpha Telescopii](Alpha_Telescopii "wikilink") is the
brightest star in the constellation. It is a blue-white
[subgiant](subgiant "wikilink") of [spectral
type](Stellar_classification#Spectral_types "wikilink") B3IV which lies
around 250 [light-years](light-year "wikilink") away. It is radiating
nearly 800 times the [Sun's luminosity](solar_luminosity "wikilink"),
and is estimated to be 5.2±0.4 times as massive and have 3.3±0.5 times
the Sun's radius. Close by Alpha Telescopii are the two blue-white stars
sharing the designation of [Delta
Telescopii](Delta_Telescopii "wikilink"). Delta¹ Telescopii is of
spectral type B6IV and apparent magnitude 4.9, while Delta² Telescopii
is of spectral type B3III and magnitude 5.1. They form an [optical
double](Double_star "wikilink"), as the stars are estimated to be around
710 and 1190 light-years away respectively. The faint (magnitude 12.23)
[Gliese 754](Gliese_754 "wikilink"), a [red dwarf](red_dwarf "wikilink")
of spectral type M4.5V, is one of the nearest 100 stars to Earth at 19.3
light-years distant. Its [eccentric
orbit](Orbital_eccentricity "wikilink") around the Galaxy indicates that
it may have originated in the Milky Way's [thick
disk](thick_disk "wikilink").

At least four of the fifteen stars visible to the unaided eye are
[orange giants](Giant_star "wikilink") of [spectral class
K](Stellar_classification#Class_K "wikilink"). The second brightest star
in the constellation—at apparent magnitude 4.1—is [Zeta
Telescopii](Zeta_Telescopii "wikilink"), an orange subgiant of spectral
type K1III-IV. Around 1.53 times as massive as the Sun, it shines with
512 times its [luminosity](luminosity "wikilink"). Located 127 light
years away from Earth, it has been described as yellow or reddish in
appearance. [Epsilon Telescopii](Epsilon_Telescopii "wikilink") is a
[binary star](binary_star "wikilink") system: the brighter component,
Epsilon Telescopii A, is an orange [giant](giant_star "wikilink") of
spectral type K0III with an [apparent
magnitude](apparent_magnitude "wikilink") of +4.52, while the 13th
magnitude companion, Epsilon Telescopii B, is 21
[arcseconds](arcsecond "wikilink") away from the primary, and just
visible with a 15 cm [aperture](aperture "wikilink") telescope on a dark
night. The system is 417 light-years away. [Iota
Telescopii](Iota_Telescopii "wikilink") and [HD
169405](HD_169405 "wikilink")—magnitude 5 orange giants of spectral
types K0III and K0.5III respectively—make up the quartet. They are
around 370 and 497 light-years away from the Sun respectively. Another
ageing star, [Kappa Telescopii](Kappa_Telescopii "wikilink") is a
[yellow giant](giant_star#Yellow_giants "wikilink") with a spectral type
G9III and apparent magnitude of 5.18. Around 1.87 billion years old,
this star of around 1.6 solar masses has swollen to 11 times the Sun's
diameter. It is approximately 293 light-years from Earth, and is another
optical double.

[Xi Telescopii](Xi_Telescopii "wikilink") is an [irregular
variable](irregular_variable "wikilink") star that ranges between
magnitudes 4.89 and 4.94. Located 1079 light-years distant, it is a [red
giant](red_giant "wikilink") of spectral type M2III that has a diameter
around 5.6 times the Sun's, and a luminosity around 2973 times that of
the Sun. Another irregular variable, [RX
Telescopii](RX_Telescopii "wikilink") is a [red
supergiant](red_supergiant "wikilink") that varies between magnitudes
6.45 and 7.47, just visible to the unaided eye under good viewing
conditions. [BL Telescopii](BL_Telescopii "wikilink") is an
[Algol](Algol_variable "wikilink")-like [eclipsing
binary](eclipsing_binary "wikilink") system that varies between
[apparent magnitudes](apparent_magnitude "wikilink") 7.09 and 9.08 over
a period of just over 778 days (2 years 48 days). The primary is a
[yellow supergiant](yellow_supergiant "wikilink") that is itself
intrinsically variable. Dipping from its baseline magnitude of 9.6 to
16.5, [RS Telescopii](RS_Telescopii "wikilink") is a rare [R Coronae
Borealis variable](R_Coronae_Borealis_variable "wikilink")—an extremely
hydrogen-deficient [supergiant](supergiant "wikilink") thought to have
arisen as the result of the merger of two [white
dwarfs](white_dwarf "wikilink"); fewer than 100 have been discovered as
of 2012. The dimming is thought to be caused by carbon dust expelled by
the star. As of 2012, four dimmings have been observed. [PV
Telescopii](PV_Telescopii "wikilink") is a class B-type (blue) [extreme
helium star](extreme_helium_star "wikilink") that is the prototype of a
class of variables known as [PV Telescopii
variables](PV_Telescopii_variable "wikilink"). First discovered in 1952,
it was found to have a very low level of hydrogen. One theory of its
origin is that it is the result of a merger between a helium- and a
carbon-oxygen white dwarf. If the combined mass does not exceed the
[Chandrasekhar limit](Chandrasekhar_limit "wikilink"), the former will
accrete onto the latter star and ignite to form a supergiant. Later this
will become an extreme helium star before cooling to become a white
dwarf.

While [RR Telescopii](RR_Telescopii "wikilink"), also designated *Nova
Telescopii 1948*, is often called a [slow
nova](Nova#Development "wikilink"), it is now classified as a [symbiotic
nova](symbiotic_nova "wikilink") system composed of an M5III pulsating
[red giant](red_giant "wikilink") and a white dwarf; between 1944 and
1948 it brightened by about 7 magnitudes before being noticed at
apparent magnitude 6.0 in mid-1948. It has since faded slowly to about
apparent magnitude 12. [QS Telescopii](QS_Telescopii "wikilink") is a
binary system composed of a white dwarf and [main
sequence](main_sequence "wikilink") donor star, in this case the two are
close enough to be [tidally locked](Tidal_locking "wikilink"), facing
one another. Known as
[polars](Polar_(cataclysmic_variable_star) "wikilink"), material from
the donor star does not form an [accretion
disk](accretion_disk "wikilink") around the white dwarf, but rather
streams directly onto it. This is due to the presence of the white
dwarf's strong [magnetic field](magnetic_field "wikilink").

Although no star systems in Telescopium have confirmed planets, several
have been found to have [brown dwarf](brown_dwarf "wikilink")
companions. A member of the 12-million-year-old [Beta Pictoris moving
group](Beta_Pictoris_moving_group "wikilink") of stars that share a
[common proper motion](common_proper_motion "wikilink") through space,
[Eta Telescopii](Eta_Telescopii "wikilink") is a young [white main
sequence star](A-type_main-sequence_star "wikilink") of magnitude 5.0
and spectral type A0V. It has a [debris disk](debris_disk "wikilink")
and brown dwarf companion of spectral type M7V or M8V that is between 20
and 50 times as massive as Jupiter. The system is complex, as it has a
common proper motion with (and is gravitationally bound to) the star [HD
181327](HD_181327 "wikilink"), which has its own debris disk. This
latter star is a [yellow-white main sequence
star](F-type_main-sequence_star "wikilink") of spectral type F6V of
magnitude 7.0. [PZ Telescopii](PZ_Telescopii "wikilink") is another
young star with a debris disk and substellar brown dwarf companion,
though at 24 million years of age appears too old to be part of the Beta
Pictoris moving group. [HD 191760](HD_191760 "wikilink") is a yellow
subgiant—a star that is cooling and expanding off the [main
sequence](main_sequence "wikilink")—of spectral type G3IV/V. Estimated
to be just over four billion years old, it is slightly (1.1 to 1.3
times) more massive as the Sun, 2.69 times as luminous, and has around
1.62 times its radius. Using the [High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet
Searcher](High_Accuracy_Radial_Velocity_Planet_Searcher "wikilink")
(HARPS) instrument on the [ESO 3.6 m
Telescope](ESO_3.6_m_Telescope "wikilink"), it was found to have a brown
dwarf around 38 times as massive as Jupiter orbiting at an average
distance of 1.35 AU with a period of 505 days. This is an unusually
close distance from the star, within a range that has been termed the
[brown-dwarf desert](brown-dwarf_desert "wikilink").

### Deep sky objects

The [Telescopium group](Telescopium_group "wikilink") is group of twelve
galaxies spanning three degrees in the northeastern part of the
constellation, lying around 37 [megaparsecs](megaparsec "wikilink") (120
million light-years) from our own galaxy. The brightest member is the
elliptical galaxy [NGC 6868](NGC_6868 "wikilink"), and to the west lies
the [spiral galaxy](spiral_galaxy "wikilink") (or, perhaps, [lenticular
galaxy](lenticular_galaxy "wikilink")) [NGC 6861](NGC_6861 "wikilink").
These are the brightest members of two respective subgroups within the
galaxy group, and are heading toward a merger in the future.

The [globular cluster](globular_cluster "wikilink") [NGC
6584](NGC_6584 "wikilink") lies near [Theta Arae](Theta_Arae "wikilink")
and is 45,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is an [Oosterhoff type
I](Oosterhoff_type_I "wikilink") cluster, and contains at least 69
variable stars, most of which are [RR Lyrae
variables](RR_Lyrae_variable "wikilink"). The [planetary
nebula](planetary_nebula "wikilink") [IC 4699](IC_4699 "wikilink") is of
13th magnitude and lies midway between Alpha and Epsilon Telescopii. [IC
4889](IC_4889 "wikilink") is an [elliptical
galaxy](elliptical_galaxy "wikilink") of apparent magnitude 11.3, which
can be found 2 degrees north-north-west of 5.3-magnitude [Nu
Telescopii](Nu_Telescopii "wikilink"). Observing it through a 40 cm
telescope will reveal its central region and halo.

Occupying an area of around 4['](arcminute "wikilink") × 2', [NGC
6845](NGC_6845 "wikilink") is an interacting system of four galaxies—two
spiral and two [lenticular galaxies](lenticular_galaxy "wikilink")—that
is estimated to be around 88 megaparsecs (287 million light-years)
distant. SN 2008da was a [type II
supernova](type_II_supernova "wikilink") observed in one of the spiral
galaxies, [NGC 6845A](NGC_6845A "wikilink"), in June 2008. [SN
1998bw](SN_1998bw "wikilink") was a luminous supernova observed in the
spiral arm of the galaxy [ESO184-G82](ESO184-G82 "wikilink") in April
1998, and is notable in that it is highly likely to be the source of the
[gamma-ray burst](gamma-ray_burst "wikilink") [GRB
980425](GRB_980425 "wikilink").
