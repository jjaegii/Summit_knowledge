# Sandstone

**Sandstone** is a [clastic sedimentary
rock](Clastic_rock#Sedimentary_clastic_rocks "wikilink") composed mainly
of [sand-sized](grain_size "wikilink") (0.0625 to 2 mm)
[silicate](silicate_mineral "wikilink") grains. Sandstones comprise
about 20â€“25% of all [sedimentary rocks](sedimentary_rock "wikilink").[1]

Most sandstone is composed of [quartz](quartz "wikilink") or
[feldspar](feldspar "wikilink"), because they are the most resistant
[minerals](mineral "wikilink") to the
[weathering](weathering "wikilink") processes at the Earth's surface.
Like uncemented [sand](sand "wikilink"), sandstone may be any color due
to impurities within the minerals, but the most common colors are tan,
brown, yellow, red, grey, pink, white, and black. Because sandstone beds
can form highly visible cliffs and other
[topographic](topography "wikilink") features, certain colors of
sandstone have become strongly identified with certain regions, such as
the red rock deserts of [Arches National
Park](Arches_National_Park "wikilink") and other areas of the [American
Southwest](Southwestern_United_States "wikilink").

Rock formations composed of sandstone usually allow the
[percolation](percolation "wikilink") of water and other fluids and are
[porous](porosity "wikilink") enough to store large quantities, making
them valuable [aquifers](aquifer "wikilink") and [petroleum
reservoirs](petroleum_reservoir "wikilink").[2][3]

Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into
[quartzite](quartzite "wikilink") through
[metamorphism](metamorphism "wikilink"), usually related to tectonic
compression within [orogenic belts](orogenic_belts "wikilink").[4][5]

## Origins

Sandstones are *[clastic](clastic_rock "wikilink")* in origin (as
opposed to either *organic*, like [chalk](chalk "wikilink") and
[coal](coal "wikilink"), or *chemical*, like [gypsum](gypsum "wikilink")
and [jasper](jasper "wikilink")).[6] The silicate sand grains from which
they form are the product of physical and chemical
[weathering](weathering "wikilink") of bedrock.[7] Weathering and
[erosion](erosion "wikilink") are most rapid in areas of high relief,
such as [volcanic arcs](volcanic_arc "wikilink"), areas of [continental
rifting](continental_rifting "wikilink"), and [orogenic
belts](orogenic_belt "wikilink").[8]

Eroded sand is transported by rivers or by the wind from its source
areas to [depositional
environments](depositional_environment "wikilink") where
[tectonics](tectonics "wikilink") has created [accommodation
space](accommodation_(geology) "wikilink") for sediments to accumulate.
[Forearc basins](Forearc_basin "wikilink") tend to accumulate sand rich
in lithic grains and [plagioclase](plagioclase "wikilink").
[Intracontinental basins](Intracontinental_basin "wikilink") and
[grabens](graben "wikilink") along continental margins are also common
environments for deposition of sand.[9]

As sediments continue to accumulate in the depositional environment,
older sand is buried by younger sediments, and it undergoes
[diagenesis](diagenesis "wikilink"). This mostly consists of
[compaction](compaction_(geology) "wikilink") and
[lithification](lithification "wikilink") of the sand.[10][11] Early
stages of diagenesis, described as *eogenesis*, take place at shallow
depths (a few tens of meters) and are characterized by
[bioturbation](bioturbation "wikilink") and mineralogical changes in the
sands, with only slight compaction.[12] The red
[hematite](hematite "wikilink") that gives [red
bed](red_beds "wikilink") sandstones their color is likely formed during
eogenesis.[13][14] Deeper burial is accompanied by *mesogenesis*, during
which most of the compaction and lithification takes place.[15]

Compaction takes place as the sand comes under increasing pressure from
overlying sediments. Sediment grains move into more compact
arrangements, ductile grains (such as [mica](mica "wikilink") grains)
are deformed, and pore space is reduced. In addition to this physical
compaction, chemical compaction may take place via [pressure
solution](pressure_solution "wikilink"). Points of contact between
grains are under the greatest strain, and the strained mineral is more
soluble than the rest of the grain. As a result, the contact points are
dissolved away, allowing the grains to come into closer contact.[16]

Lithification follows closely on compaction, as increased temperatures
at depth hasten deposition of [cement](Cementation_(geology) "wikilink")
that binds the grains together. Pressure solution contributes to
cementing, as the mineral dissolved from strained contact points is
redeposited in the unstrained pore spaces.[17]

Mechanical compaction takes place primarily at depths less than .
Chemical compaction continues to depths of , and most cementation takes
place at depths of .[18]

Unroofing of buried sandstone is accompanied by *telogenesis*, the third
and final stage of diagenesis.[19] As erosion reduces the depth of
burial, renewed exposure to [meteoric water](meteoric_water "wikilink")
produces additional changes to the sandstone, such as dissolution of
some of the cement to produce [secondary
porosity](secondary_porosity "wikilink").[20]

## Components

### Framework grains

Framework grains are sand-sized ( diameter) detrital fragments that make
up the bulk of a sandstone.[21][22] Most framework grains are composed
of [quartz](quartz "wikilink") or [feldspar](feldspar "wikilink"), which
are the common minerals most resistant to
[weathering](weathering "wikilink") processes at the Earth's surface, as
seen in the [Goldich dissolution
series](Goldich_dissolution_series "wikilink").[23] Framework grains can
be classified into several different categories based on their mineral
composition:

-   Quartz framework grains are the dominant minerals in most [clastic
    sedimentary rocks](clastic_sedimentary_rock "wikilink"); this is
    because they have exceptional physical properties, such as
    [hardness](hardness "wikilink") and chemical stability.[24] These
    physical properties allow the quartz grains to survive multiple
    recycling events, while also allowing the grains to display some
    degree of rounding.[25] Quartz grains evolve from plutonic rock,
    which are felsic in origin and also from older sandstones that have
    been recycled.
-   Feldspathic framework grains are commonly the second most abundant
    mineral in sandstones.[26] Feldspar can be divided into alkali
    feldspars and plagioclase feldspars, which can be distinguished
    under a petrographic microscope.[27]

    - [Alkali feldspar](Alkali_feldspar "wikilink") range in chemical
composition from KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> to
NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>.[28]
    - [Plagioclase feldspar](Plagioclase_feldspar "wikilink") range in
composition from NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> to
CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>.[29] 

-   Lithic framework grains (also called lithic fragments or lithic
    clasts) are pieces of ancient source rock that have yet to weather
    away to individual mineral grains.[30] Lithic fragments can be any
    fine-grained or coarse-grained igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary
    rock,[31] although the most common lithic fragments found in
    sedimentary rocks are clasts of volcanic rocks.[32]
-   Accessory minerals are all other mineral grains in a sandstone.
    These minerals usually make up just a small percentage of the grains
    in a sandstone. Common accessory minerals include micas
    ([muscovite](muscovite "wikilink") and
    [biotite](biotite "wikilink")), [olivine](olivine "wikilink"),
    [pyroxene](pyroxene "wikilink"), and
    [corundum](corundum "wikilink").[33][34] Many of these accessory
    grains are more dense than the silicates that make up the bulk of
    the rock. These *[heavy minerals](heavy_mineral "wikilink")* are
    commonly resistant to weathering and can be used as an indicator of
    sandstone maturity through the [ZTR
    index](ZTR_index "wikilink").[35] Common heavy minerals include
    [zircon](zircon "wikilink"), [tourmaline](tourmaline "wikilink"),
    [rutile](rutile "wikilink") (hence *ZTR*),
    [garnet](garnet "wikilink"), [magnetite](magnetite "wikilink"), or
    other dense, resistant minerals derived from the source rock.

### Matrix

[Matrix](Matrix_(geology) "wikilink") is very fine material, which is
present within interstitial pore space between the framework grains.[36]
The nature of the matrix within the interstitial pore space results in a
twofold classification:

-   Arenites are texturally *clean* sandstones that are free of or have
    very little matrix.[37]
-   Wackes are texturally *dirty* sandstones that have a significant
    amount of matrix.[38]

### Cement

Cement is what binds the siliciclastic framework grains together. Cement
is a secondary mineral that forms after deposition and during burial of
the sandstone.[39] These cementing materials may be either silicate
minerals or non-silicate minerals, such as calcite.[40]

-   Silica cement can consist of either quartz or
    [opal](opal "wikilink") minerals. Quartz is the most common silicate
    mineral that acts as cement. In sandstone where there is silica
    cement present, the quartz grains are attached to cement, which
    creates a rim around the quartz grain called overgrowth. The
    overgrowth retains the same crystallographic continuity of quartz
    framework grain that is being cemented. Opal cement is found in
    sandstones that are rich in [volcanogenic](volcano "wikilink")
    materials, and very rarely is in other sandstones.[41]
-   Calcite cement is the most common carbonate cement. Calcite cement
    is an assortment of smaller calcite crystals. The cement adheres to
    the framework grains, cementing the framework grains together.[42]
-   Other minerals that act as cements include:
    [hematite](hematite "wikilink"), [limonite](limonite "wikilink"),
    [feldspars](feldspar "wikilink"), [anhydrite](anhydrite "wikilink"),
    [gypsum](gypsum "wikilink"), [barite](barite "wikilink"), [clay
    minerals](clay_minerals "wikilink"), and
    [zeolite](zeolite "wikilink") minerals.[43]

Sandstone that becomes depleted of its cement binder through weathering
gradually becomes friable and unstable. This process can be somewhat
reversed by the application of tetraethyl orthosilicate
(Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>) which will deposit
amorphous silicon dioxide between the sand grains.[44] The reaction is
as follows.

  
Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub> (l) + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O (l) â†’
SiO<sub>2</sub> (s) + 4 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH (g)

### Pore space

Pore space includes the open spaces within a rock or a soil.[45] The
pore space in a rock has a direct relationship to the
[porosity](porosity "wikilink") and
[permeability](permeability_(earth_sciences) "wikilink") of the rock.
The porosity and permeability are directly influenced by the way the
sand grains are packed together.[46]

-   Porosity is the percentage of bulk volume that is inhabited by
    interstices within a given rock.[47] Porosity is directly influenced
    by the packing of even-sized spherical grains, rearranged from
    loosely packed to tightest packed in sandstones.[48]
-   Permeability is the rate in which water or other fluids flow through
    the rock. For [groundwater](groundwater "wikilink"), work
    permeability may be measured in gallons per day through a one square
    foot cross section under a unit [hydraulic
    gradient](hydraulic_gradient "wikilink").[49]

## Types of sandstone

Sandstones are typically classified by point-counting a [thin
section](thin_section "wikilink") using a method like the
[Gazzi-Dickinson Method](Gazzi-Dickinson_Method "wikilink"). This yields
the relative percentages of quartz, feldspar, and lithic grains and the
amount of clay matrix. The composition of a sandstone can provide
important information on the genesis of the sediments when used with a
triangular *Q*uartz, *F*eldspar, *L*ithic fragment ([QFL
diagrams](QFL_diagrams "wikilink")). However, geologist have not been
able to agree on a set of boundaries separating regions of the QFL
triangle.[50] 

Visual aids are diagrams that allow geologists to interpret different
characteristics of a sandstone. For example, a QFL chart can be marked
with a [provenance](Provenance_(geology) "wikilink") model that shows
the likely tectonic origin of sandstones with various compositions of
framework grains. Likewise, the stage of textural maturity chart
illustrates the different stages that a sandstone goes through as the
degree of kinetic processing of the sediments increases. 

-   A QFL chart is a representation of the framework grains and matrix
    that is present in a sandstone. This chart is similar to those used
    in igneous petrology. When plotted correctly, this model of analysis
    creates for a meaningful quantitative classification of
    sandstones.[51]
-   A sandstone provenance chart is typically based on a QFL chart but
    allows geologists to visually interpret the different types of
    places from which sandstones can originate.
-   A stage of textural maturity chart shows the differences between
    immature, submature, mature, and supermature sandstones. As the
    sandstone becomes more mature, grains become more rounded, and there
    is less clay in the matrix of the rock.[52]

### Dott's classification scheme

Dott's (1964) sandstone classification scheme is one of many such
schemes used by geologists for classifying sandstones. Dott's scheme is
a modification of Gilbert's classification of silicate sandstones, and
it incorporates R.L. Folk's dual textural and compositional maturity
concepts into one classification system.[53] The philosophy behind
combining Gilbert's and R. L. Folk's schemes is that it is better able
to "portray the continuous nature of textural variation from mudstone to
arenite and from stable to unstable grain composition".[54] Dott's
classification scheme is based on the mineralogy of framework grains,
and on the type of matrix present in between the framework grains.

In this specific classification scheme, Dott has set the boundary
between arenite and wackes at 15% matrix. In addition, Dott also breaks
up the different types of framework grains that can be present in a
sandstone into three major categories: quartz, feldspar, and lithic
grains.[55]

-   Arenites are types of sandstone that have less than 15% clay matrix
    in between the framework grains.
    -   Quartz arenites are sandstones that contain more than 90% of
        siliceous grains. Grains can include [quartz](quartz "wikilink")
        or [chert](chert "wikilink") rock fragments.[56] Quartz arenites
        are texturally mature to supermature sandstones. These pure
        quartz sands result from extensive
        [weathering](weathering "wikilink") that occurred before and
        during transport. This weathering removed everything but quartz
        grains, the most stable [mineral](mineral "wikilink"). They are
        commonly affiliated with rocks that are deposited in a stable
        cratonic environment, such as aeolian
        [beaches](beach "wikilink") or shelf environments.[57] Quartz
        arenites emanate from multiple recycling of quartz grains,
        generally as sedimentary source rocks and less regularly as
        first-cycle deposits derived from primary
        [igneous](igneous "wikilink") or [metamorphic
        rocks](metamorphic_rock "wikilink").[58]
    -   Feldspathic arenites are sandstones that contain less than 90%
        quartz, and more feldspar than unstable lithic fragments, and
        minor accessory minerals.[59] Feldspathic sandstones are
        commonly immature or sub-mature.[60] These sandstones occur in
        association with cratonic or stable shelf settings.[61]
        Feldspathic sandstones are derived from granitic-type, primary
        crystalline, rocks.[62] If the sandstone is dominantly
        plagioclase, then it is igneous in origin.[63]
    -   Lithic arenites are characterised by generally high content of
        unstable lithic fragments. Examples include volcanic and
        metamorphic clasts, though stable clasts such as chert are
        common in lithic arenites.[64] This type of rock contains less
        than 90% quartz grains and more unstable rock fragments than
        feldspars.[65] They are commonly immature to submature
        texturally.[66] They are associated with fluvial conglomerates
        and other fluvial deposits, or in deeper water marine
        conglomerates.[67] They are formed under conditions that produce
        large volumes of unstable material, derived from fine-grained
        rocks, mostly [shales](shale "wikilink"), [volcanic
        rocks](volcanic_rock "wikilink"), and [metamorphic
        rock](metamorphic_rock "wikilink").[68]
-   Wackes are sandstones that contain more than 15% clay matrix between
    framework grains.
    -   Quartz wackes are uncommon because quartz arenites are
        texturally mature to supermature.[69]
    -   Felspathic wackes are feldspathic sandstone that contain a
        matrix that is greater than 15%.[70]
    -   Lithic wacke is a sandstone in which the matrix greater than
        15%.[71]
-   [Arkose](Arkose "wikilink") sandstones are more than 25 percent
    [feldspar](feldspar "wikilink").[72] The grains tend to be poorly
    rounded and less well sorted than those of pure quartz sandstones.
    These feldspar-rich sandstones come from rapidly eroding
    [granitic](granitic "wikilink") and metamorphic
    [terrains](terrain "wikilink") where [chemical
    weathering](chemical_weathering "wikilink") is
    [subordinate](subordinate "wikilink") to [physical
    weathering](physical_weathering "wikilink").
-   [Greywacke](Greywacke "wikilink") sandstones are a
    [heterogeneous](heterogeneous "wikilink") mixture of [lithic
    fragments](Lithic_Fragment_(geology) "wikilink") and angular grains
    of quartz and feldspar or grains surrounded by a fine-grained
    [clay](Clay_mineral "wikilink") matrix. Much of this
    [matrix](Matrix_(geology) "wikilink") is formed by relatively soft
    fragments, such as [shale](shale "wikilink") and some volcanic
    rocks, that are chemically altered and physically compacted after
    deep burial of the sandstone formation.

### Quartzite

When sandstone is subjected to the great heat and pressure associated
with [regional metamorphism](regional_metamorphism "wikilink"), the
individual quartz grains recrystallize, along with the former cementing
material, to form the [metamorphic rock](metamorphic_rock "wikilink")
called [quartzite](quartzite "wikilink"). Most or all of the original
texture and sedimentary structures of the sandstone are erased by the
metamorphism.[73] The grains are so tightly interlocked that when the
rock is broken, it fractures through the grains to form an irregular or
conchoidal fracture.[74]

Geologists had recognized by 1941 that some rocks show the macroscopic
characteristics of quartzite, even though they have not undergone
metamorphism at high pressure and temperature. These rocks have been
subject only to the much lower temperatures and pressures associated
with [diagenesis](diagenesis "wikilink") of sedimentary rock, but
diagenesis has cemented the rock so thoroughly that microscopic
examination is necessary to distinguish it from metamorphic quartzite.
The term *orthoquartzite* is used to distinguish such sedimentary rock
from *metaquartzite* produced by metamorphism. By extension, the term
*orthoquartzite* has occasionally been more generally applied to any
quartz-cemented [quartz arenite](quartz_arenite "wikilink").
Orthoquartzite (in the narrow sense) is often 99% SiO<sub>2</sub> with
only very minor amounts of iron oxide and trace resistant minerals such
as [zircon](zircon "wikilink"), [rutile](rutile "wikilink") and
[magnetite](magnetite "wikilink"). Although few
[fossils](fossil "wikilink") are normally present, the original texture
and [sedimentary](sedimentary "wikilink") structures are
preserved.[75][76]

The typical distinction between a true orthoquartzite and an ordinary
quartz sandstone is that an orthoquartzite is so highly cemented that it
will fracture across grains, not around them.[77] This is a distinction
that can be recognized in the [field](Field_work "wikilink"). In turn,
the distinction between an orthoquartzite and a metaquartzite is the
onset of recrystallization of existing grains. The dividing line may be
placed at the point where strained quartz grains begin to be replaced by
new, unstrained, small quartz grains, producing a *mortar texture* that
can be identified in thin sections under a polarizing microscope. With
increasing grade of metamorphism, further recrystallization produces
*foam texture*, characterized by polygonal grains meeting at triple
junctions, and then *porphyroblastic texture*, characterized by coarse,
irregular grains, including some larger grains
([porphyroblasts](porphyroblast "wikilink").)[78]

## Uses

Sandstone has been used since prehistoric times for
construction,[79][80] decorative art works[81] and tools.[82] It has
been widely employed around the world in constructing temples,[83]
churches,[84] homes and other buildings, and in [civil
engineering](civil_engineering "wikilink").[85]

Although its resistance to [weathering](weathering "wikilink") varies,
sandstone is easy to work. That makes it a common
[building](building_material "wikilink") and
[paving](pavement_(material) "wikilink") material, including in [asphalt
concrete](asphalt_concrete "wikilink"). However, some types that have
been used in the past, such as the [Collyhurst
sandstone](Collyhurst_sandstone "wikilink") used in [North West
England](North_West_England "wikilink"), have had poor long-term weather
resistance, necessitating repair and replacement in older buildings.[86]
Because of the hardness of individual grains, uniformity of grain size
and [friability](friability "wikilink") of their structure, some types
of sandstone are excellent materials from which to make
[grindstones](grindstone_(tool) "wikilink"), for sharpening blades and
other implements.[87] Non-friable sandstone can be used to make
grindstones for grinding grain, e.g., [gritstone](gritstone "wikilink").

A type of pure quartz sandstone, orthoquartzite, with more of 90â€“95
percent of quartz,[88] has been proposed for nomination to the [Global
Heritage Stone Resource](Global_Heritage_Stone_Resource "wikilink").[89]
In some regions of Argentina, the orthoquartzite-stoned
[facade](facade "wikilink") is one of the main features of the [Mar del
Plata style](Mar_del_Plata_style "wikilink") bungalows.[90]
