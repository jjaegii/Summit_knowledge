# Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania–Massachusetts)

**Interstate 84** (**I-84**) is an [Interstate
Highway](Interstate_Highway_System "wikilink") in the [Northeastern
United States](Northeastern_United_States "wikilink") that extends from
[Dunmore, Pennsylvania](Dunmore,_Pennsylvania "wikilink"), near
[Scranton](Scranton,_Pennsylvania "wikilink") at an interchange with
[I-81](Interstate_81 "wikilink") east to [Sturbridge,
Massachusetts](Sturbridge,_Massachusetts "wikilink"), at an interchange
with the [Massachusetts Turnpike](Massachusetts_Turnpike "wikilink")
([I-90](Interstate_90 "wikilink")). Among the major cities that the road
passes through is [Hartford,
Connecticut](Hartford,_Connecticut "wikilink"), and the road provides a
major portion of the primary route between [New York
City](New_York_City "wikilink") and [Boston](Boston "wikilink").
[Another highway named I-84](Interstate_84_(Oregon–Utah) "wikilink") is
located in the [Northwestern United
States](Northwestern_United_States "wikilink").

## Route description

### Pennsylvania

I-84 starts in Pennsylvania at [I-81](Interstate_81 "wikilink") in
[Dunmore](Dunmore,_Pennsylvania "wikilink"), a suburb east of
[Scranton](Scranton,_Pennsylvania "wikilink"). After , I-84 interchanges
with [I-380](Interstate_380_(Pennsylvania) "wikilink"), with I-380 going
southeast through the [Pocono Mountains](Pocono_Mountains "wikilink")
and I-84 continuing almost due east into
[Wayne](Wayne_County,_Pennsylvania "wikilink") and
[Pike](Pike_County,_Pennsylvania "wikilink") counties. Pennsylvania
began replacing [sequential exit
numbers](Sequential_exit_numbering "wikilink") with [mile-based
numbers](Mile-based_exit_numbering "wikilink") in 2001.

This section of Pennsylvania is very lightly populated, and there are no
major settlements on or near I-84, although it offers access to popular
outdoor recreation areas such as [Lake
Wallenpaupack](Lake_Wallenpaupack "wikilink") and [Promised Land State
Park](Promised_Land_State_Park "wikilink"). Its
[right-of-way](Right-of-way_(transportation) "wikilink") is very wide,
with a large [median strip](median_strip "wikilink") between the two
roadways as it passes through densely wooded country, except for the
swampy areas in southern Wayne County. The only development along
Pennsylvania's section of I-84 is where [US
Route 6](U.S._Route_6_in_Pennsylvania "wikilink") (US 6) and
[US 209](U.S._Route_209 "wikilink") start to parallel closely and form a
commercial strip just south of
[Matamoras](Matamoras,_Pennsylvania "wikilink"), just west of the
[Delaware River](Delaware_River "wikilink"). I-84 reaches its highest
elevation in Pennsylvania and in the east just west of exit 8 at .

### New York

I-84 enters New York by crossing both the
[Delaware](Delaware_River "wikilink") and
[Neversink](Neversink_River "wikilink") rivers on a long bridge south of
[Port Jervis](Port_Jervis,_New_York "wikilink"), the first large
settlement near the highway. South of the road, at the confluence of the
Delaware and Neversink rivers, is the [Tri-States
Monument](Tri-States_Monument "wikilink"), where [New
Jersey](New_Jersey "wikilink"), New York, and Pennsylvania converge.
The first mile () of the road in New York runs along the [New
Jersey](New_Jersey "wikilink") state line, then curves to the north to
climb the [Shawangunk Ridge](Shawangunk_Ridge "wikilink") and cross
[Orange County](Orange_County,_New_York "wikilink"), where it intersects
[New York State Route 17](New_York_State_Route_17 "wikilink") (NY 17;
future [I-86](Interstate_86_(Pennsylvania–New_York) "wikilink")) and
later the [New York State Thruway](New_York_State_Thruway "wikilink")
([I-87](Interstate_87_(New_York) "wikilink")). I-84 includes the
[Newburgh–Beacon Bridge](Newburgh–Beacon_Bridge "wikilink") across the
[Hudson River](Hudson_River "wikilink") at
[Newburgh](Newburgh,_New_York "wikilink").

East of the bridge and the city of
[Beacon](Beacon,_New_York "wikilink"), I-84 continues to head east
across [Dutchess County](Dutchess_County,_New_York "wikilink"),
beginning to turn south in the mountainous areas east of the [Taconic
State Parkway](Taconic_State_Parkway "wikilink") and into [Putnam
County](Putnam_County,_New_York "wikilink"). At
[Brewster](Brewster,_New_York "wikilink"), where
[I-684](Interstate_684 "wikilink") heads south toward New York City, the
road resumes its eastern course into Connecticut, closely paralleled by
[US 6](U.S._Route_6_in_New_York "wikilink") and
[US 202](U.S._Route_202_in_New_York "wikilink"). The [New York State
Department of
Transportation](New_York_State_Department_of_Transportation "wikilink")
(NYSDOT) completed the process of converting exits from sequential to
mile-based numbering as part of a sign replacement project in 2021.

### Connecticut

The Interstate's first exit is at the state line, where it enters the
city of [Danbury](Danbury,_Connecticut "wikilink"). Here, it is
designated the Yankee Expressway. to the east, where
[US 7](U.S._Route_7_in_Connecticut "wikilink") comes in from the south
near [Danbury Fair](Danbury_Fair_(shopping_mall) "wikilink") to join
I-84, it turns to the north. At the next exit,
[US 6](U.S._Route_6_in_Connecticut "wikilink") and
[US 202](U.S._Route_202_in_Connecticut "wikilink") join the highway.

The four-way concurrency ends after , when US 7 and US 202 split off
north toward [New Milford](New_Milford,_Connecticut "wikilink"). US 6
leaves the Interstate at the next exit, and I-84 continues east across
the countryside. At exit 11, it turns to the northeast and descends to
cross the [Housatonic River](Housatonic_River "wikilink") on the
Rochambeau Bridge, into [New Haven
County](New_Haven_County,_Connecticut "wikilink"). It then climbs onto
higher ground to the city of
[Waterbury](Waterbury,_Connecticut "wikilink"), which it passes on an
elevated [viaduct](viaduct "wikilink") with the eastbound and westbound
lanes on different levels. Here, the
[Route 8](Connecticut_Route_8 "wikilink") expressway intersects.

The eastern heading continues past Waterbury to
[Milldale](Milldale_(Southington) "wikilink"), where
[I-691](Interstate_691 "wikilink") splits off to the east. This section
has many left-hand exits and entrances and sharp curves, which were
built for a planned network of freeways. I-84 heads northeast toward
[New Britain](New_Britain,_Connecticut "wikilink") and
[Hartford](Hartford,_Connecticut "wikilink"), the state capital and the
largest community along its eastern length. After intersecting
[I-91](Interstate_91 "wikilink"), the road crosses the [Connecticut
River](Connecticut_River "wikilink") on the [Bulkeley
Bridge](Bulkeley_Bridge "wikilink"), the oldest on the Interstate
System, then becomes the [Wilbur Cross
Highway](Wilbur_Cross_Highway "wikilink") and continues toward the
northeast. I-84 services the greater student body commuting to the
[University of Connecticut](University_of_Connecticut "wikilink")
through exit 68 located in rural
[Tolland](Tolland,_Connecticut "wikilink").

The last exit in Connecticut is exit 74, an exit for
[Route 171](Connecticut_Route_171 "wikilink"). I-84 crosses the
Massachusetts border in the town of
[Union](Union,_Connecticut "wikilink").

### Massachusetts

The Wilbur Cross Highway continues on I-84 after the highway crosses the
state line. For a short distance (approximately eastbound and
westbound), the Interstate passes through the town of
[Holland](Holland,_Massachusetts "wikilink") in [Hampden
County](Hampden_County,_Massachusetts "wikilink") before crossing into
[Sturbridge](Sturbridge,_Massachusetts "wikilink") in [Worcester
County](Worcester_County,_Massachusetts "wikilink") for the remainder of
its length. I-84 has only three exits in Massachusetts, before ending at
[I-90](Interstate_90 "wikilink"), the [Massachusetts
Turnpike](Massachusetts_Turnpike "wikilink"). I-84 ends at exit 78
(formerly exit 9) of I-90, which is located in Sturbridge, into the
state, making the Massachusetts section of the highway the shortest
distance within any of the four states it traverses.

## History

I-84 was originally to head east from [Hartford,
Connecticut](Hartford,_Connecticut "wikilink"), to [Providence, Rhode
Island](Providence,_Rhode_Island "wikilink").

The original route of I-84 would have used present-day
[I-384](Interstate_384 "wikilink") to [Bolton,
Connecticut](Bolton,_Connecticut "wikilink"), then along a never-built
section of freeway that would have connected to the
[US 6](U.S._Route_6 "wikilink") bypass around [Willimantic,
Connecticut](Willimantic,_Connecticut "wikilink"). Another never-built
freeway section would have connected it to I-395 and extended I-84 onto
[State Road 695](State_Road_695_(Connecticut) "wikilink") (SR 695) in
Connecticut, the easternmost portion of the [Connecticut
Turnpike](Connecticut_Turnpike "wikilink") in [Plainfield,
Connecticut](Plainfield,_Connecticut "wikilink"). From there, it would
have roughly followed US 6 through western [Rhode
Island](Rhode_Island "wikilink") to connect to the present-day US 6
freeway in [Johnston](Johnston,_Rhode_Island "wikilink"). From there, a
freeway from [Olneyville Square](Olneyville_Square "wikilink") to the
[I-95](Interstate_95 "wikilink")/[I-195](Interstate_195_(Rhode_Island–Massachusetts) "wikilink")
interchange was briefly considered but abandoned in favor of what later
became the [Route 6-10 Connector](Route_6-10_Connector "wikilink").

Sections of I-84 in Connecticut were reconstructed and widened in the
1980s. The former I-86 portion from East Hartford to the Massachusetts
state line was completely rebuilt from a narrow four-lane freeway to a
much wider profile ranging from six lanes at the Massachusetts state
line, expanding to eight lanes in Vernon, to 12 lanes with
[high-occupancy vehicle lanes](high-occupancy_vehicle_lane "wikilink")
(HOV lanes) in East Hartford. Another section through Danbury was
widened from four lanes to six lanes in 1985 and 1986. Widening of the
highway through Danbury was funded by [Union
Carbide](Union_Carbide "wikilink") as part of building its world
headquarters in Danbury.

Though the route was confirmed in [Connecticut](Connecticut "wikilink"),
many issues remained in Rhode Island, the biggest of which were major
environmental concerns about how the freeway would affect the [Scituate
Reservoir](Scituate_Reservoir "wikilink"), which is the main drinking
water supply for Providence. In an attempt to ease environmental
concerns, an alternate route was briefly studied in Rhode Island that
would have connected I-84 to the present-day
[Route 37](Route_37_(Rhode_Island) "wikilink") freeway. This would have
allowed construction of I-84 south of the Scituate Reservoir. Major
community opposition caused this plan, as well as all plans for a
Hartford–Providence expressway, to be scrapped in the 1980s.

In the 1992 long-range transportation plan released by the [Rhode Island
Department of
Transportation](Rhode_Island_Department_of_Transportation "wikilink"), a
freeway was added along the original route of I-84 that will connect to
the [SR 695](State_Road_695_(Connecticut) "wikilink") freeway on the
Rhode Island–Connecticut border.

### I-86 relation

The section of I-84 between [East Hartford,
Connecticut](East_Hartford,_Connecticut "wikilink"), (at the present-day
junction with [I-384](Interstate_384 "wikilink")) and [Sturbridge,
Massachusetts](Sturbridge,_Massachusetts "wikilink"),
([I-90](Interstate_90 "wikilink")) was signed in the late 1970s and
early 1980s as I-86 (unrelated to present-day
[I-86](Interstate_86_(Pennsylvania–New_York) "wikilink") in [New
York](New_York_(state) "wikilink") and
[Pennsylvania](Pennsylvania "wikilink")). Signs stating "I-84 Ends, I-86
to [Boston](Boston "wikilink")" (eastbound) and "I-86 Ends, I-84 to
Hartford" (westbound) were posted where the change took place. Exit
numbering on I-86 was that of the road's predecessor,
[Route 15](Connecticut_Route_15 "wikilink"), in a sequence beginning on
New York's [Hutchinson River
Parkway](Hutchinson_River_Parkway "wikilink"). Exits were renumbered to
correspond with the rest of I-84 in Connecticut when the road was
redesignated in 1984. The present I-384 as well as the present US 6
bypass near Willimantic, both of which were a part of what was then
I-84's planned easterly continuation, were also numbered I-84 prior to
1984 even though they lacked any direct connection to the rest of I-84
at that time. (Drivers had to use Silver Lane in East Hartford to travel
between the two stretches of the highway.) These two sections were
re-numbered I-384 and US 6 when what was then I-86 numbering reverted to
I-84, with signs reading "I-84 is now I-384", "I-84 is now US 6", and
"I-86 is now I-84" being erected on their respective segments.

### Tolls

As I-84 was built with federal funds, there are generally no highway
tolls. The exception is I-84's [Hudson River](Hudson_River "wikilink")
crossing, the [Newburgh–Beacon
Bridge](Newburgh–Beacon_Bridge "wikilink"). Since the bridge is under
the [New York State Bridge
Authority](New_York_State_Bridge_Authority "wikilink"), it carries an
eastbound-only toll of $2.15 for passenger vehicles (EZ Pass $1.65).

#### Transfer to New York State Thruway Authority

From 1992 through 2006, I-84 in [New York](New_York_(state) "wikilink")
was a toll-free component of the [New York State
Thruway](New_York_State_Thruway "wikilink") system. It was transferred
by NYSDOT to the [New York State Thruway
Authority](New_York_State_Thruway_Authority "wikilink") (NYSTA) in order
to capitalize on that agency's steady revenue stream from upstate
sources.

In 1992, maintenance responsibility for I-84 in New York was transferred
to the NYSTA and the monies for that purpose came from existing tolls on
[I-190](Interstate_190_(New_York) "wikilink") in downtown
[Buffalo](Buffalo,_New_York "wikilink"), more than away. On October 30,
2006, the NYSTA began the process of returning maintenance and operation
responsibilities to NYSDOT and the tolls in Buffalo were discontinued.
The I-190 tolls were considered to be one of the principal causes of
highway congestion in Buffalo. From 2006 to 2010, maintenance was
performed by the NYSTA with funding provided by the state legislature.
On October 11, 2010, NYSDOT resumed full control of I-84.

### Widening projects in Waterbury

A widening project along the congested stretch of I-84 through
[Waterbury](Waterbury,_Connecticut "wikilink") and
[Cheshire](Cheshire,_Connecticut "wikilink"), Connecticut, was beset by
cost overruns, delays, and construction defects involving storm
drains, as state and federal officials have launched criminal
investigations stemming from this project. This episode diminished local
enthusiasm for a proposed $2-billion reconstruction of the "Mixmaster"
interchange in downtown Waterbury between Route 8 and I-84. Cost
estimates for the Mixmaster replacement have increased to $3 billion.
Former Connecticut Attorney-General [Richard
Blumenthal](Richard_Blumenthal "wikilink") began a lawsuit against the
contractor and an engineering firm in response to threats from USDOT to
withhold funds from the project. On May 18, 2007, the
*[Republican-American](Republican-American "wikilink")* reported this
area had defective light poles, while Governor [Jodi
Rell](Jodi_Rell "wikilink") released an audit report of the construction
disaster. A number of USDOT personnel were either fired or
reprimanded following the scandal. Additionally, the [Federal Bureau of
Investigation](Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation "wikilink") (FBI) and a
federal grand jury investigated the now-defunct construction company and
the same USDOT officials, although none of these investigations have yet
to result in criminal charges.

## Auxiliary routes

I-84 has two current and two former [auxiliary
routes](List_of_auxiliary_Interstate_Highways "wikilink").
[I-384](Interstate_384 "wikilink") is a spur of I-84 in [Manchester,
Connecticut](Manchester,_Connecticut "wikilink").
[I-684](Interstate_684 "wikilink") connects I-84 in [Brewster, New
York](Brewster,_New_York "wikilink"), with
[I-287](Interstate_287 "wikilink") in [Harrison, New
York](Harrison,_New_York "wikilink"). [I-284](Interstate_284 "wikilink")
was a planned but never built expressway relocation of
[US 5](U.S._Route_5_in_Connecticut "wikilink") to bypass [East Hartford,
Connecticut](East_Hartford,_Connecticut "wikilink"), along the eastern
shore of the [Connecticut River](Connecticut_River "wikilink").
[I-484](Interstate_484 "wikilink") was slated to be built south of
downtown [Hartford, Connecticut](Hartford,_Connecticut "wikilink"),
(connecting with [I-91](Interstate_91 "wikilink")), but that highway was
never completed.
