# Dolly (sheep)

**Dolly** (5 July 1996 – 14 February 2003) was a female
[Finn-Dorset](Finn-Dorset "wikilink") sheep and the first
[mammal](mammal "wikilink") that was [cloned](cloned "wikilink") from an
adult [somatic cell](somatic_cell "wikilink"). She was cloned by
associates of the [Roslin Institute](Roslin_Institute "wikilink") in
Scotland, using the process of [nuclear
transfer](nuclear_transfer "wikilink") from a cell taken from a [mammary
gland](mammary_gland "wikilink"). Her cloning proved that a cloned
organism could be produced from a mature cell from a specific body
part. Contrary to popular belief, she was not the first animal to be
cloned.

The employment of adult somatic cells in lieu of [embryonic stem
cells](embryonic_stem_cell "wikilink") for cloning emerged from the
foundational work of [John Gurdon](John_Gurdon "wikilink"), who cloned
[African clawed frogs](African_clawed_frog "wikilink") in 1958 with this
approach. The successful cloning of Dolly led to widespread advancements
within stem cell research, including the discovery of [induced
pluripotent stem cells](induced_pluripotent_stem_cell "wikilink").

Dolly lived at the Roslin Institute throughout her life and produced
several lambs. She was euthanized at the age of six years due to a
progressive lung disease. No cause which linked the disease to her
cloning was found.

Dolly's body was preserved and donated by the Roslin Institute in
Scotland to the [National Museum of
Scotland](National_Museum_of_Scotland "wikilink"), where it has been
regularly exhibited since 2003.

## Genesis

Dolly was [cloned](Cloning "wikilink") by [Keith
Campbell](Keith_Campbell_(biologist) "wikilink"), [Ian
Wilmut](Ian_Wilmut "wikilink") and colleagues at the [Roslin
Institute](Roslin_Institute "wikilink"), part of the [University of
Edinburgh](University_of_Edinburgh "wikilink"), Scotland, and the
biotechnology company PPL Therapeutics, based near
[Edinburgh](Edinburgh "wikilink"). The funding for Dolly's cloning was
provided by PPL Therapeutics and the [Ministry of
Agriculture](Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs "wikilink").
She was born on 5 July 1996 and died on 14 February 2003 from a
progressive lung disease that was considered unrelated to her being a
clone. She has been called "the world's most famous sheep" by sources
including [BBC News](BBC_News "wikilink") and *[Scientific
American](Scientific_American "wikilink")*.

The cell used as the donor for the cloning of Dolly was taken from a
[mammary gland](mammary_gland "wikilink"), and the production of a
healthy clone, therefore, proved that a cell taken from a specific part
of the body could recreate a whole individual. On Dolly's name, Wilmut
stated "Dolly is derived from a mammary gland cell and we couldn't think
of a more impressive pair of glands than [Dolly
Parton](Dolly_Parton "wikilink")'s."

## Birth

Dolly was born on 5 July 1996 and had three mothers: one provided the
egg, another the DNA, and a third carried the cloned embryo to term.
She was created using the technique of [somatic cell nuclear
transfer](somatic_cell_nuclear_transfer "wikilink"), where the [cell
nucleus](cell_nucleus "wikilink") from an adult cell is transferred into
an unfertilized [oocyte](oocyte "wikilink") (developing egg cell) that
has had its cell nucleus removed. The hybrid cell is then stimulated to
divide by an electric shock, and when it develops into a
[blastocyst](blastocyst "wikilink") it is implanted in a surrogate
mother. Dolly was the first clone produced from a cell taken from an
adult mammal. The production of Dolly showed that genes in the
nucleus of such a mature
[differentiated](cellular_differentiation "wikilink") somatic cell are
still capable of reverting to an embryonic
[totipotent](Totipotency "wikilink") state, creating a cell that can
then go on to develop into any part of an animal.

Dolly's existence was announced to the public on 22 February 1997.
It gained much attention in the media. A commercial with Scottish
scientists playing with sheep was aired on TV, and a special report in
*Time* magazine featured Dolly.
*[Science](Science_(journal) "wikilink")* featured Dolly as the
[breakthrough of the year](Breakthrough_of_the_Year "wikilink"). Even
though Dolly was not the first animal cloned, she received media
attention because she was the first cloned from an adult cell.

## Life

Dolly lived her entire life at the [Roslin Institute](Roslin_Institute "wikilink") 
in Midlothian. There she was bred with a [Welsh Mountain
ram](Welsh_Mountain_sheep "wikilink") and produced six lambs in total.
Her first lamb, named Bonnie, was born in April 1998. The next year,
Dolly produced twin lambs Sally and Rosie; further, she gave birth to
triplets Lucy, Darcy and Cotton in 2000. In late 2001, at the age of
four, Dolly developed [arthritis](arthritis "wikilink") and began to
walk stiffly. This was treated with
[anti-inflammatory](anti-inflammatory "wikilink") drugs.

## Death

On 14 February 2003, Dolly was
[euthanised](Animal_euthanasia "wikilink") because she had a progressive
lung disease and severe arthritis. A [Finn
Dorset](Finnish_Dorset_sheep "wikilink") such as Dolly has a life
expectancy of around 11 to 12 years, but Dolly lived 6.5 years. A
post-mortem examination showed she had a form of lung cancer called
[ovine pulmonary
adenocarcinoma](ovine_pulmonary_adenocarcinoma "wikilink"), also known
as Jaagsiekte, which is a fairly common disease of sheep and is
caused by the [retrovirus](retrovirus "wikilink")
[JSRV](JSRV "wikilink"). Roslin scientists stated that they did not
think there was a connection with Dolly being a clone, and that other
sheep in the same flock had died of the same disease. Such lung
diseases are a particular danger for sheep kept indoors, and Dolly had
to sleep inside for security reasons.

Some in the press speculated that a contributing factor to Dolly's death
was that she could have been born with a genetic age of six years, the
same age as the sheep from which she was cloned. One basis for this
idea was the finding that Dolly's [telomeres](telomeres "wikilink") were
short, which is typically a result of the [aging](aging "wikilink")
process. The Roslin Institute stated that intensive health
screening did not reveal any abnormalities in Dolly that could have come
from advanced aging.

In 2016, scientists reported no defects in thirteen cloned sheep,
including four from the same cell line as Dolly. The first study to
review the long-term health outcomes of cloning, the authors found no
evidence of late-onset, non-communicable diseases other than some minor
examples of osteoarthritis and concluded "We could find no evidence,
therefore, of a detrimental long-term effect of cloning by SCNT on the
health of aged offspring among our cohort."

After her death Dolly's body was preserved via taxidermy and is
currently on display at the [National Museum of
Scotland](National_Museum_of_Scotland "wikilink") in Edinburgh.

## Legacy

After cloning was successfully demonstrated through the production of
Dolly, many other large mammals were cloned, including pigs,
[deer](deer "wikilink"), horses and bulls. The attempt to
clone [argali](argali "wikilink") (mountain sheep) did not produce
viable embryos. The attempt to clone a [banteng](banteng "wikilink")
bull was more successful, as were the attempts to clone
[mouflon](mouflon "wikilink") (a form of wild sheep), both resulting in
viable offspring. The reprogramming process that cells need to go
through during cloning is not perfect and embryos produced by nuclear
transfer often show abnormal development. Making cloned mammals
was highly inefficientin 1996, Dolly was the only lamb that survived to
adulthood from 277 attempts. By 2014, Chinese scientists were reported
to have 70–80% success rates cloning pigs, and in 2016, a Korean
company, Sooam Biotech, was producing 500 cloned embryos a day.
Wilmut, who led the team that created Dolly, announced in 2007 that the
nuclear transfer technique may never be sufficiently efficient for use
in humans.

Cloning may have uses in preserving endangered species, and may become a
viable tool for reviving [extinct species](Extinction "wikilink").
In January 2009, scientists from the Centre of Food Technology and
Research of Aragon in northern Spain announced the cloning of the
[Pyrenean ibex](Pyrenean_ibex "wikilink"), a form of wild mountain goat,
which was officially declared extinct in 2000. Although the newborn ibex
died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs, it is the
first time an extinct animal has been cloned, and may open doors for
saving endangered and newly extinct species by resurrecting them from
frozen tissue.

In July 2016, four identical clones of Dolly (Daisy, Debbie, Dianna, and
Denise) were alive and healthy at nine years old.

[Scientific American](Scientific_American "wikilink") concluded in
2016 that the main legacy of Dolly has not been cloning of animals but
in advances into [stem cell](stem_cell "wikilink") research. After
Dolly, researchers realised that ordinary cells could be reprogrammed to
[induced pluripotent stem
cells](Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell "wikilink"), which can be grown
into any tissue.

The first successful cloning of a [primate species](Primate "wikilink")
was reported in January 2018, using the same method which produced
Dolly. Two identical clones of a [macaque](macaque "wikilink") monkey,
[Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua](Zhong_Zhong_and_Hua_Hua "wikilink"), were
created by researchers in China and were born in late
2017.

In January 2019, scientists in China reported the creation of five
identical cloned [gene-edited](Genome_editing "wikilink") monkeys, again
using this method, and the gene-editing
[CRISPR](CRISPR "wikilink")-[Cas9](Cas9 "wikilink") technique allegedly
used by [He Jiankui](He_Jiankui "wikilink") in creating the first ever
gene-modified human babies [Lulu and Nana](Lulu_and_Nana "wikilink").
The monkey clones were made in order to study several medical
diseases.
